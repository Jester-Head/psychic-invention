Every thread is “Fire is bad” “Arcane is bad” “Frost is bad”,"Nov 16, 2022 10:16 pm",Mage
What’s the truth between the overreactions? This is the most unreadable forum on Blizz forums…,"Nov 16, 2022 10:29 pm",Mage
"In beta fire is #1 dps of all classes, arcane is middle of the pack and frost is dead last. But, they just buffed arcane

Arcane Barrage damage increased by 8%.","Nov 16, 2022 11:26 pm",Mage

"No one has a good handle on class balance. Even if they did, tuning is happening constantly so their understanding could change any day. We only have a handle on class feel right now. Mage does not feel awful. I know fire and arcane players have generally been happy. Frost I’ve seen some more mixed reactions because of icy propulsion.","Nov 17, 2022 2:23 pm",Mage
There are a lot of doomers who enjoy posting negatively though. The beat advice i could give is play them and choose for yourself. You can only judge the feel at the moment.,"Nov 17, 2022 6:13 pm",Mage
Tuning is not worth commenting on for a while yet. No one knows what specs are tuned best at the moment; this is nothing more than a guess.,"Nov 17, 2022 9:46 pm",Mage
"I can’t speak for everyone, but my own personal doom-speak has mostly been centered around the missed potential in the talent trees.","Nov 17, 2022 9:51 pm",Mage
"A lot of our complaints were that mages weren’t iterated on much, and we never got feedback from the person / persons working on our class to understand where they wanted to go.","Nov 17, 2022 10:17 pm",Mage
"We saw a fresh start with revamped talent trees and we waited with starry eyes and bated breath and we were essentially handed last week’s reheated mutton. It’s still good. It’ll provide the nourishment we need, but it lacks the flavor and excitement that we want.","Nov 18, 2022 8:44 am",Mage
I’m still gonna be here. I’m still gonna play arcane. But I’m also absolutely going to complain about what we could’ve had.,"Nov 18, 2022 10:15 am",Mage
"At the end of the day, I’m sure they’ll find a way to make all three mage specs viable. The only issue right now is that it may force people to take talents they don’t want. I’m not sure Blizzard has the capacity to keep every possibly build balanced (nor would I expect them to with the size of these trees).","Nov 18, 2022 12:42 pm",Mage
"Yup, pretty much this. It’s not so much an issue with viability (though maybe it is a little bit of that too where Frost is concerned) but missed potential.","Nov 18, 2022 1:17 pm",Mage
Very early on it became painfully obvious that the shift from talent tiers to trees was more of an afterthought than an expansion linchpin feature for them. That’s why feedback was so aggressive and gloomy.,"Nov 18, 2022 2:40 pm",Mage
It’s especially frustrating for specs like Arcane which were in dire need of an overhaul and the talent revamps were the perfect missed opportunity.,"Nov 18, 2022 5:18 pm",Mage
To focus on a specific grievance: for me it’s mind boggling that their solution to the long standing problem of not wanting to use Arcane Barrage in single target situations was to double down on the cooldown stacking damage multipliers and include a tedious ramp up mechanic (Arcane Harmony stacks) when the whole problem there to begin with was the tedious ramp up of having to get back to 4 Arcane Charges after using ABarr. Of all the solutions and tools at their disposal that’s what they came up with… it really doesn’t inspire confidence and breeds the whole doom and gloom rhetoric.,"Nov 18, 2022 5:29 pm",Mage
"To be honest, I don’t think that this would’ve been a problem if they would never have given us Touch of the Magi as a 45 second cooldown. If they would’ve let it be a random proc like it was in Legion and not removed Charge Up, we wouldn’t feel so pressured to build these stacks.","Nov 18, 2022 6:03 pm",Mage
The Ice Lance and Frostbolt nerfs were unwarranted. The healthpools in DF are close to 300k HP. Frostbolt is literally hitting for like 2% of someone’s HP non-crit up to 6% HP with a shatter combo crit. Frost literally feels like garbage. There’s no reason you can’t buff PvP if you’re worried about making frost OP for PvE. This last round of nerfs was extremely heavy handed. Arcane was already the best on DF beta with Frost and Fire behind by quite a bit. Now it’s not even close. Frost does ZERO damage now and is unviable.,"Nov 12, 2022 12:38 pm",Mage
"I wholeheartedly agree!
I have been saying this on both the Alpha and the Beta.
No spec should be this far behind the others.","Nov 17, 2022 1:19 pm",Mage
It sucks. The spec is barely cohesive. It’s full of abilities that make no sense with the theme and requires a lot of thinking to use efficiently.,"Nov 18, 2022 11:44 am",Mage
"I mean, displacement, on top of alter time, 45-sec cooldown dragon’s breath, while also juggling with the diminish-returns of roots and polymorph. It’s madness.","Nov 18, 2022 5:54 pm",Mage
"And when you somehow manage to cast, it’s like you’re a clown with a water pistol.","Nov 18, 2022 6:16 pm",Mage
"I rolled a shadow priest, I barely have any gear, and it already pumps more than my decently geared frost mage.","Nov 18, 2022 7:07 pm",Mage
Utility is great… Not complaining about the utility at all. DRs are easy to manage if you are used to doing so. I am literally only concerned with the low damage output. If they get a decent damage buff Frost will literally be insane.,"Nov 19, 2022 12:04 am",Mage
"Sure. Enjoy your 35 abilities. I’m certain you’ve mastered how to use blast waves, dragon’s breath, ice nova, displacement, and all that other fluff added to our kit to make the class an absolute pain to play under pressure.","Nov 19, 2022 6:40 am",Mage
I’d say im doing pretty decent lol… 2.1 in RSS as frost without really trying too hard.,"Nov 19, 2022 11:18 am",Mage
"Hate to break it to you, but its actually good for the spec and the class as a whole. Now we have answers for the mobility creep melee have received for the last 2 expansions.","Nov 19, 2022 11:55 am",Mage
"Instead of giving us more abilities, they could’ve made the abilities that we already have better at what they’re supposed to do (Keeping an opponent away from you.) As frost, we shouldn’t even have blast waves. There should instead be a talent to give similar power to cone of cold.","Nov 19, 2022 12:21 pm",Mage
"Instead of giving us displacement, they could’ve simply given us some blink talent that resets the cooldown after receiving a CC effect or something.","Nov 19, 2022 1:04 pm",Mage
This game is stuck in the past if it thinks the solution to anything is bloating a class with abilities. MMO mouses aren’t something everyone likes using.,"Nov 19, 2022 3:37 pm",Mage
??? What does any of those spells have to do with damage…,"Nov 19, 2022 3:59 pm",Mage
Also speak for yourself having blast wave and db baseline is awesome. Give me more abilities,"Nov 19, 2022 5:51 pm",Mage
"Dont act like most people like pruning. Mop classes are mostly loved by people and df is mimicking mop.

"I read the WoWHead guide for fire mage and the rotation, heck, even the opener seem super complicated to get used to. In my mind Fire Mage players are 180 IQ geniuses, I just can’t figure the spec out no matter how much I put my mind into it.","Nov 18, 2022 5:09 pm",Mage
How do you guys do it?,"Nov 18, 2022 11:50 pm",Mage
"You can try using a rotation helper as a guide somewhat, but you can also watch videos too.","Nov 19, 2022 3:57 pm",Mage

"it’s so infuriating how much people love it. It is designed to limit our mobility, not to give us power. Don’t you see that? And everyone accepts it as the best thing ever. Can we have a mage build not centered around the horrendous rune of power for once? FFS","Nov 11, 2022 2:39 am",Mage
"I don’t think they do though. The only people I’ve seen who say they like it are often shown to only care about the numbers, or want to feel superior with the “it’s just because you don’t know how to use it”. ROP in a raid environment is super easy to use (use CDs in that 15s gap when DBM says you can, much hard!) and if it were nerfed to a much lower damage gain those people would drop it like it’s hot.","Nov 11, 2022 3:14 am",Mage
"As said in other threads, the worst part about ROP is how much of the gameplay and power allocation for Mage centres around ROP. Getting rid of it would instantly open up more builds, more interaction and more fun.","Nov 11, 2022 8:25 am",Mage
"Yeah, you kind of said it.
I’m not a prolific class-tester, but off the top of my head I don’t know of any other talent that can be described like this: “YOU: Don’t move.”","Nov 11, 2022 1:11 pm",Mage

"Hi, I was trying to learn arcane and from what I understand part of the class is dealing with mana issues however ive never actually ran out of mana using my standard rotation. What am I doing wrong or not using properly that’s not having me deal with the mana issues the arcane spec has?

"How much haste you working with? Its kinda changed alot with pre patch, mana problems are not generally an issue unless your in AOE or tons of haste, like M+ with the bonus.

"Its really fun, you really can put out more damage based on your mana management. I wouldnt worry about it now, but late game if you always have mana, its likely you could do more DPS in M+ by finding ways to dump it.

"Arcane doesn’t play like your typical builder-spender classes. At least, not historically.","Nov 6, 2022 5:11 pm",Mage

The problem is I loathed that build and as I said above quit playing altogether rather than being forced into it. The only other remotely viable build appears to revolve around the Arcane Orb capstone “Orb Barrage” but even that also pretty much requires taking the Arcane Harmony capstone. My problem there is that (1) Orb Barrage should have had the effect of the Mantle of the First Kirin Tor legendary from Legion and (2) it basically still plays exactly like the Kyrian Harmony build but without Radiant Spark.","Nov 17, 2022 10:01 pm",Mage

It does not help that something as simple as replacing the BfA Clearcasting graphic with the Legion Arcane Missile graphic has been ignored.

Suggested fixes for DF:,"Oct 18, 2022 9:45 pm",Mage
Fix : Allow Instant Cast Pyroblasts and Flamestrikes to trigger Sun Kings Blessing,"Oct 19, 2022 2:23 am",Mage
"Reason: It feels god-awful to try to proc Sun Kings Blessing with a long cast Pyroblast or Flamestrike, especially during movement phases, it is a terrible DPS loss and would make the spec feel fluid.","Oct 19, 2022 10:35 am",Mage
Fix: Remove Ring of Power and buff Mage damage across the board,"Oct 19, 2022 4:49 pm",Mage
"Reason: Ring of Power is an annoying spell that has plagued the Mage class for expansion after expansion. Nobody likes it, it kills mobility, and utterly kills your DPS if you move out of it. It turns the “mobile” Fire Mage into a turret class. The damage gained by Ring of Power doesn’t elevate Mages above other classes’ DPS; it handicaps them. Buff class damage overall by a specific percentage and do away with Rune of Power and its equivalent cousins.","Oct 20, 2022 7:39 am",Mage
"Fix: Remove Scorch and buff Fireball’s damage and lower its cast time (and allow speed boost and 30% crit proc specialty). Allow it to be cast on the move, maybe under specific conditions or abilities such as Shamans cast on the move ability. Buff Pyroblast and Flamestrike damage and lower hard cast time. Allow only a specific amount of instant procs for Pyroblast and Flamestrike during Combustion/SKB.","Oct 25, 2022 2:31 pm",Mage
"Reason: Mage class is too spammy overall, especially Fire Mage, for relatively low damage outside of a ROP/Combustion/SKB combo. This would make Fire Mages better outside of their cooldowns and spread load their damage out. Combustion/SKB would still be strong but being stuck with hard casts wouldn’t drop your DPS by a terrible amount.","Oct 25, 2022 3:14 pm",Mage

Oh i know and its stupid cause i dont understand it with the talent trees back they can introduce a ton of builds to make the end game raiders happy and to mage the casuals happy the talent trees can literally mage fire a pure 100% dot build with ignite being the primary focus or minute mage where you cast a ton spells or be a nuke spec where you deal a ton of high damage pyros with a slower play style but nope fire mage plays the same with 0 changr in rotation or mechanics etc,"Oct 26, 2022 1:16 pm",Mage

"Wowhead included it (and Master of Time) in their suggested Frost questing build which made me think, why?","Oct 31, 2022 8:54 am",Mage
"Its has a lot of uses. in dungeons and raid when you have to run to do a mechanic and need to move back pop AT.
a big damge window is coming in 1 sec? hit AT when its over or if you get really low end it and heal back to full.
jump off a cliff to pretend to kill yourself and AT back =D","Oct 31, 2022 9:22 am",Mage
"Remember that it doesn’t just save your location, it saves your health. While you’re out questing, you can use it as a defensive CD while waiting for your shield to come back up again. Say you pull a few mobs:
-they get through your shield, and aren’t close to dead yet
-pop Alter Time
-mobs beat on you- oh noooooo my health is loooooow
-reactivate Alter Time to bring your health back to where you were
-Ice Nova etc. until shield is ready again","Nov 4, 2022 12:36 pm",Mage
"It also has a ton of uses in dungeons. You can use it for movement, such as if you need to drop off something out of the way, but you can also use it to undo big damage if you know it’s coming- just pop it before the boss/mob does the bad thing and end it when the damage is done (or before you die)","Nov 4, 2022 6:17 pm",Mage
"I use it constantly in PVP. Pop it early and often. at the beginning of a battle, if you try and use when you see that you need it it can be too late. Remember you do not have to wait the full 10 secs to pop it if you see your health dropping fast.","Nov 5, 2022 8:22 am",Mage
Mages are fun but take practice to stay alive in tricky situations.,"Nov 6, 2022 8:44 am",Mage
"Ditto on using it in PvP. On my Goblin mage, I double shimmer, alter time and rock jump CONSTANTLY in fights to mess with my opponents to great effect.","Nov 14, 2022 12:27 pm",Mage
"I consider myself an arcane veteran in PvE content. Alter Time is that one spell that I’m constantly forgetting about and realizing “man, that would’ve saved my life”.","Nov 14, 2022 8:39 pm",Mage
But as of the talent changes I mostly use it and immediately reactivate / cancel the buff to get the movement speed from Temporal Velocity…,"Nov 14, 2022 8:52 pm",Mage
its hysterical in bgs,"Nov 14, 2022 9:52 pm",Mage
Thanks for the suggestions. I don’t pvp on the mage so that may be part of why I’d overlooked it.,"Nov 15, 2022 8:16 am",Mage
It has many uses but I wouldn’t call it useful. Let me explain.,"Nov 15, 2022 11:48 am",Mage
"deleted, wrong forum","Nov 14, 2022 1:31 pm",Mage
Nether Tempest is a joke… please increase it’s damage or add talents to improve the spell.,"Oct 31, 2022 8:54 pm",Mage
"As far as I know, NT hasn’t been worth using since Mists. Admittedly back then it was so brokenly OP that it was used by all specs and AoE fights revolved entirely around spamming it on every target but still. You’d think whichever salty dev would have gotten over it by now and would just make it at least viable.","Nov 1, 2022 3:37 am",Mage
"It’s a slight dmg add, but not a key killer on it’s own. It would be nice if duration was about 2-3 times longer, or had an infectious nature to it, so it could hop to additional targets, or reapply if a new mob gets infected, something like that.","Nov 8, 2022 3:10 pm",Mage
I believe people on the beta have been using it just before touch of the magi?,"Nov 9, 2022 8:27 pm",Mage
"Maybe not the ideal situation, but at least it’s being used?","Nov 10, 2022 6:40 am",Mage
yeah I made a build using that set up. it’s so much fun but other classes still out pace you by 100%. it’s ridiculous.,"Nov 10, 2022 7:07 am",Mage
NT’s only purpose now is to buff your TotM window … cause Arcane mages needed another low damage doing damage modifier to increase the insane ramp up lol.,"Nov 11, 2022 1:00 pm",Mage
Wellll will say rn its basically just meant to be a conduit to make arcane echo doo more dmg.,"Nov 14, 2022 8:55 am",Mage
yeah ramp up time is ridiculous. /sigh. by the time you ramp up all the other classes are a head of you by so much that catching up in the damage meters seems pointless.,"Nov 14, 2022 10:04 am",Mage
"Love it, and when it comes to a crowd of mobs I am melting their faces off all while basically evocating on mana, couldn’t be happier.","Oct 27, 2022 5:25 pm",Mage
"When it comes to boss fights, on the other hand, I am feeling pretty weak in the knees. A full minute and half in a boss fight means I might see a second burst if at all. And I better not have used it on the mobs right before the fight.","Oct 28, 2022 1:13 am",Mage
"To Blizzard, I would be willing to give up some talent points in other areas to reduce the cooldown of arcane surge. And if there is already something out there I’m missing, please let me know.","Oct 28, 2022 7:25 pm",Mage
As a pvper i love the animation but i feel arcane Power+ 3 insta blast does more dmg. A castable burst is kinda weird,"Oct 30, 2022 3:43 pm",Mage
I’d be content with Surge if it was instant cast. That’s the only thing holding it back IMO.,"Oct 31, 2022 9:36 am",Mage
They just need to reduce its cast. I should be a similar cast time to poly,"Nov 1, 2022 4:11 pm",Mage
"Assuming you are using ROP the second charge is always there and returns in 45sec. I know it is hated but the key to its success is to just pop it, you will get better in the timing of it. It seems many are so concerned with popping it at the wrong time they don’t use it at all.","Nov 1, 2022 5:01 pm",Mage
"Yes the only downside is in PVP, anyone with a basic knowledge of mages will Interupt or LOS your Arcane Surge cast, and they do have a 2.2 - 2.5 sec window to counter it, which is quite long in pvp","Nov 2, 2022 1:04 pm",Mage
If they instant cast it my bet is the dmg will be nurfed. It can blow up a room of toons ATM.,"Nov 13, 2022 5:33 pm",Mage
"a huge annoyance as well, ICE FLOWS does not modify arcane surge for some reason. This is clearly a bug that still hasnt been fixed.","Nov 13, 2022 6:31 pm",Mage
Single target its kinda bad for a burst ability.,"Nov 13, 2022 7:23 pm",Mage
"It seems like with their increased 2% crit damage that they would be a better choice for Fire, but what about with Frost or Arcane?","Nov 12, 2022 3:11 pm",Mage
"For single target, tauren sims the highest for fire and frost, not for arcane. For multi target scenarios it only sims highest for fire. And in any situation we’re only talking about fractions of a percent difference so it mostly doesn’t matter unless you were looking for an excuse to reroll","Nov 13, 2022 6:07 am",Mage
They also get more stamina for bigger shields and a stun with warstomp. Yeah. They’re probably the best.,"Nov 13, 2022 12:29 pm",Mage
Oh god why…,"Nov 13, 2022 5:29 pm",Mage
"Statistically, I guess it makes sense. But Tauren do not look good in cloth. Just saying.","Nov 13, 2022 5:31 pm",Mage
