Let me start with the things I like about Faeline Stomp (FLS),"Nov 14, 2022 6:05 pm",Monk
Now here are the reasons I hate it,"Nov 14, 2022 7:32 pm",Monk
Here are some ways this ability could be improved. These wouldn’t necessarily have to be implemented together – I would be happy to see ANY of these things happen.,"Nov 14, 2022 9:53 pm",Monk
"In conclusion, I appreciate having a new way to refresh Ancient Teachings, but I hate that it’s Faeline Stomp. Thank you for your time.","Nov 14, 2022 10:49 pm",Monk
"+1. Like the idea, mechanically speaking, but it’s not thematic in the slightest and definitely needs a few QoL updates, cause it feels horrendously clunky right now.","Nov 15, 2022 12:50 am",Monk
"When you cast it, it doesn’t have blue directly beneath your feet -but iirc it still counts as ‘in’ the faeline, even, which is just…c’mon. It needs more polish.","Nov 15, 2022 10:44 am",Monk
"That said, I do kind of like the reset mechanic - it adds some variability into the rotation that a 15 sec cooldown wouldn’t, and back to back procs can put out some really satisfying AoE healing/damage. I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with RNG though, so I get that it’s not everyone’s cup of tea (it certainly isn’t mine all the time, either).","Nov 15, 2022 10:52 am",Monk
"Yes please, I need the ability to look like a Monk spell.
They changed Mindgames animation to look shadowy, they really need to do this for all covenant spells that are returning.","Nov 15, 2022 11:54 am",Monk
"I think some of your suggestions are excellent. I too hate the look of stomp - it really doesn’t fit the aesthetic of mw at all. The proc for stomp is largely useless. When pumping heals you are only going to be stomping to maintain the line to stand in. I’m not sure I agree with you about EF mana cost - using Rising mist to maintain EF you are going to cast it as soon as EF drops regardless of what healing the group needs.
I don’t think upwelling will be really used tbh.","Nov 15, 2022 11:57 am",Monk
maybe I’m misunderstanding. do you mean the ancient teachings proc?,"Nov 17, 2022 11:09 am",Monk
The buff you want to maintain is EF itself for the double gusts. Teachings is conveniently the same duration as the EF buff if you spec rising mist. Stomp is just for the buff (fae line) every 30s or when you move. It isn’t worth casting every proc. Teachings is 100% up just from EF. Playing this way is super mana efficient.,"Nov 18, 2022 4:08 pm",Monk
"While I don’t hate the idea of giving it a monk themed coat of paint, (I think there should be like 3x as many glyphs to customize spell effects) that spell looks so, so good.","Nov 18, 2022 7:43 pm",Monk
Used it for a while but I don’t really care for it either. I’ve been using Rising Mist in keys and like it better.,"Nov 19, 2022 1:25 am",Monk
"My thought would be to uncouple the effects from the line completely.
Damage enemies in a cone in front (have the line as a standard visual effect rather then a continuing ground effect) and heal nearby allies. Then the reset mechanic would be just always active on the player.","Nov 19, 2022 2:53 am",Monk
Could use a cost reduction as well.,"Nov 19, 2022 5:01 pm",Monk
There’s like one-ish build for fistweaving but there could be so much more if Blizz would just go full hog and make it a melee spec.,"Nov 18, 2022 11:02 pm",Monk
Im glad the talent tree supports both styles and lets us pepper in as much of whichever style we want into a build.,"Nov 19, 2022 12:16 am",Monk
"There would, in fact, be less if they removed the entire caster side of things. xD","Nov 19, 2022 1:22 am",Monk
"mostly depends on what you are considering caster focused, cause the only talents which are explicitly not useful for fistweaving are like the five Soothing Mist talents.","Nov 19, 2022 12:00 pm",Monk
"Most of the important Caster/Fist choices are in choice nodes (e.g. Clouded Focus/Ancient Teachings and Tear of Morning/Rising Mist), which is how they should be done, unlike the HPal tree where it’s all mixed.","Nov 19, 2022 2:21 pm",Monk
"Although Faeline Stomp nodes being useless for Caster and SooM nodes being useless for Fist isn’t great, but still better than HPal.","Nov 19, 2022 3:15 pm",Monk
"Oh yeah because an honest reading of my OP implies that instead of replacing the casting talents, they should just lob half the tree off. That’s what full hog means to me.","Nov 19, 2022 4:29 pm",Monk
"Currently Thunder Focus Tea only empowers Enveloping Mist, Renewing Mist, Vivify, Rising Sun Kick, and Essence Font. With the developers bringing back more of the Fistweaving options to the game, I believe it’s time to revamp Thunder Focus Tea to now include Tiger Palm and Blackout Kick. Depending on what the developers feel the Mistweaver (Fistweaving) needs, they could incorporate some needed help.","Nov 19, 2022 12:48 pm",Monk

Hello all.,"Nov 13, 2022 7:44 pm",Monk
"Before I start digging through endless guides about gear, abilities and rotation, I thought I would try my luck here first with a few questions regarding the state of Brewmaster for leveling and in the new expac. So here we go…","Nov 14, 2022 11:46 am",Monk
1.) It seems like all the content posted on the Interwebs states that all tanks are kicking butt right now on the Beta…except Brewmaster and Paladin… Is this true? I have no frame of reference as this was going to be my first serious tank…,"Nov 14, 2022 1:06 pm",Monk
2.) Also coming off the tail of question one… How Tanky/Durable is the spec right now? I have only ran a few Legion Dungeons and felt pretty squishy…,"Nov 14, 2022 1:48 pm",Monk
"3.) Another issue players seem to have is “Ability Bloat”. My charecter is 47ish at the moment… How is the “Ability Bloat” for Brewmasters right now? I am used to more streamlined DPS classes for the most part, so does it get alot worse regarding the keybinds?","Nov 15, 2022 7:41 am",Monk
"4.) How is the spec for PVP usefulness? I understand that Tanks in PVP Arenas are kind of a meme, but I dont plan on running any Rated Arenas or Rated BG’s with this spec. Does the Stagger effect work well for guarding Graveyards in Alterac or Spinning Flags in Arathi Basin?","Nov 15, 2022 7:50 am",Monk
"I know that there are alot of resources out there, but sometimes its nice to get feedback from the players directly. Any help is much appriciated guys!!!","Nov 15, 2022 2:51 pm",Monk
I KSM’ed on every tank in S3 and S4. I’ve played every tank on the BETA as well. BrM was my fav SL tank.,"Nov 15, 2022 3:15 pm",Monk
"Right now, my tank ranking is Warr = VDH > BDK > “new” Guardian >> Pally >> BrM. They recently buffed Guardian and it feels pretty broken so I expect a nerf.","Nov 15, 2022 5:19 pm",Monk
VDH and Warr feel AMAZING.,"Nov 17, 2022 12:47 am",Monk
i don’t pvp so i have no idea about that. for pve:,"Nov 17, 2022 3:55 am",Monk
"i think it’ll be a strong tank in the hands of the right player, but prot warrior is going to give good results for half the effort","Nov 17, 2022 10:39 am",Monk
Thanks for all the feedback guys!,"Nov 17, 2022 7:39 pm",Monk
I really don’t want to “park” this character just because it’s bottom tier for tanking at the moment. I really enjoy the drunken brawler theme and feel of the class.,"Nov 17, 2022 8:26 pm",Monk
"At the end of the day, isn’t that more important than the meta??","Nov 18, 2022 6:35 am",Monk
"Wouldnt worry to much unless your joining a mythic+ infinity guild, all tanks can do the content just some do it better then others. If you like playing brm then go with that. As long as you are good at at it you will find groups, just probably not a the highest tier where the min/max stat balance is crazy.","Nov 18, 2022 9:43 pm",Monk
BrM are the tankiest specs on the game. They will shrug off 1 shot mechanics like they are autoswings and keep going.,"Nov 19, 2022 10:57 am",Monk
"For what feels like the first time in a long time, the spec feels like it could sit towards the top of the healing food chain at the start of an expansion. Despite our lack of utility, mana concerns, single target throughput AND big healing CD, things were looking good.","Nov 14, 2022 4:57 pm",Monk
"All the recent changes, esp the 40% stamina / damage changes, seems to have completely negated any positive community sentiment about the class. Whats with this? Can we be a lil op for once…?","Nov 14, 2022 7:34 pm",Monk
"I believe at lvl 70 Monks will be in a really good spot, they just lack in pre-patch.
In Beta Monks were topping hps in raiding, haven’t seen much M+ but with full talent tree monks can do good dmg and a lot of healing plus now they can have an interrupt.","Nov 15, 2022 12:43 am",Monk
"Apparently that was only pre nerfs, now they’re struggling again and considered the worst.","Nov 15, 2022 3:52 am",Monk
"they need to make soothing mists trigger gusts. this would make monks amazing, and there is plenty of talents to support it","Nov 15, 2022 7:53 am",Monk
Who ever said that is not that smart.,"Nov 15, 2022 12:00 pm",Monk
MW is still S tier above a lot of other. They still out dps and put heal nearly everyone on beta.,"Nov 15, 2022 1:20 pm",Monk
"Yes, give us a reason to cast SooM. It’s like the base fantasy of MW, but there’s no incentive to use it anymore, except when someone is getting absolutely trucked.","Nov 15, 2022 1:25 pm",Monk
I feel like a lot of the soothing mist support is not really all that good since it’s all either single target focused or has the ‘this effect is lost when soothing mist ends’ line which doesn’t work when more then half of the kit breaks soothing mist.,"Nov 15, 2022 2:50 pm",Monk
"My man still spreading fake news on the wow forums, keep it going bro","Nov 15, 2022 4:35 pm",Monk
"you can cast most things instacast with soom. Part of the problem here, is that im seeing tanks with 10k hps on themselves. They made tanks wildly op in pve compared to previous expacs. Ive seen tanks pull 20 mobs in a heroic and not even need heal. Why is this a thing?","Nov 15, 2022 5:14 pm",Monk
"You can cast EnvM and Vivify instantly with Soom. Also, Expel Harm will copy to your SooM target. That’s it. Particularly with the Vivacious Vivification (instant Viv every 10s) talent, and no interaction with Mastery, SooM is kinda garbage.","Nov 16, 2022 4:54 am",Monk
"SooM does have mastery interaction, it’s just that since we don’t hold the spell for that long you can’t really expect when the deck system will draw the mastery hit.","Nov 16, 2022 9:56 pm",Monk
"Yea, SooM does proc Mastery. IIRC it averages out to 1 Gusts per full channel with a higher chance of proccing early.","Nov 17, 2022 12:41 am",Monk
sounds like a bug since it isnt mentioned in mastery tooltip? or its intended? Perhaps SooM can have increased ticks with haste?,"Nov 17, 2022 2:52 am",Monk
"Not to mention the current bug where ancient teachings has been bugged in a few newer additions. Healing Uldaman with a useless 10% heal from damage was a lot harder than I wanted to to be (my teammates didn’t help, but that’s to be expected.)","Nov 17, 2022 3:11 am",Monk
"I’ve heard they’re fine in raids, but every healer whom I watch is putting MW at the bottom for M+…usually below or beside Rsham (both of which are my healers. I also have a Preservation Evoker but not sure I’ll have as a main alt.)","Nov 17, 2022 5:31 am",Monk
I love it when hidden profiles comment on these things. I went from disregarding your opinion to thinking “well maybe they actually do a lot of M+ and have some insight” back to “oh hidden profile to hide their lack of experience.”,"Nov 17, 2022 10:12 am",Monk
I’d love a 1.5M CD that lets us channel to 3-4 targets for 10/12 seconds.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:25 pm",Monk
"This is a great point. In an era with tanks who largely keep themselves alive, the monk kit that either does great raid healing OR ST healing is bound to have more issues in 5mans than a healer should.","Nov 18, 2022 1:12 am",Monk
"The “Echoing Reverberations” talent should not require both a Renewing Mist and an Enveloping Mist, it should only require one or the other. Making it require both makes it obnoxious to use and difficult to justify, costing way too many GCDs. It isn’t a powerful enough ability or talent that it should require extra hoops to jump through.","Oct 27, 2022 2:09 am",Monk
"agreed. seems weak, not really worth the effort… like most of our damage output options.","Nov 15, 2022 5:51 pm",Monk
"Agreed, it’s basically a full heal in a lot of cases, requiring EM on the target is overkill on healing and defeats the purpose of its mana efficiency.","Nov 17, 2022 2:48 pm",Monk
It should apply renewing mist not require it.,"Nov 18, 2022 6:40 am",Monk
"The Blizz monk team has never been able to figure out what they want to do with Zen Pulse. It’s been redesigned so many times, and everytime being the least picked choice with the former talent system.","Nov 18, 2022 12:23 pm",Monk
"For sure, Zen Pulse and Chi Wave have literally just been placeholder talents for years.","Nov 18, 2022 1:34 pm",Monk
"ZP’s talented buffs are also just…meh…one needs ren+env on the target to get the one talent effect - the other requires you to sit for 6 soo mist ticks and then rush to use ZP in the last 1-3 seconds before the buff falls off, by then either the damage was healed up if in a raid by someone else, or the group is dead if in m+ because you just cant do that and sitting around soomisting is bad MW play. Even if JSS knocks off 2-3 seconds and it’s SooMist counts to stacking it is just meh.","Nov 19, 2022 3:10 am",Monk
"Ahoy Monks,","Nov 18, 2022 6:07 pm",Monk
"I played this Brewmaster Monk in Legion I believe, raided and all. I loved the play style of drinking to gain more stagger all the time, and drinking again to release all the stagger.","Nov 18, 2022 7:45 pm",Monk
Haven’t touched Monk since; and was thinking of boosting one on another server to be my main.,"Nov 18, 2022 11:31 pm",Monk
"I’d love to play mistweaver, but I’m finding it impossible to choose monk as my main with the state of brewmaster. It is squishy to the point of not being a viable tank. The disparity is so large you could drop a bonkers change like making all stagger damage vanish into thin air, and it would STILL be squishier than a prot warrior. Y’all really can’t be this bad at math. Please fix.","Nov 15, 2022 4:16 pm",Monk
"Also. Since you’ve made mastery absolutely necessary for brewmaster, it probably shouldn’t be a completely dead stat for fistweaving. This will need 2 entirely different gear sets to be not just optimal, but functional. People who role flex are very good for your game. Don’t make life crappy for them.","Nov 15, 2022 5:44 pm",Monk
Mastery isn’t completely dead with fistweaving due to 1 min Chi Ji,"Nov 16, 2022 10:53 am",Monk
"I’ve been playing BrM for a few days now and I don’t feel squishy at all. BrM is a bit of a higher skill cap compared to most other tanks, but its always been that way.","Nov 16, 2022 1:17 pm",Monk
I actually think the spec feels really good right now and I haven’t had any problems doing PUGs.,"Nov 18, 2022 10:21 pm",Monk
My friend and I never played arena too much but he mains a WW monk and wants to try in DF. I am looking for a good healer that will be good with a WW monk. Any help would be great!,"Nov 18, 2022 5:59 pm",Monk
"More than just the Damage.
Could be something small like causing Rising Sun Kick to give a stack of Elusive Brawler.
Or perhaps Rising Sun Kick could Reduce the Cooldown of your Brews like Keg Smash or Tiger Palm?","Nov 17, 2022 2:04 pm",Monk
"On Windwalker. RSK does big damage, can hit twice, and it’s cooldown is reduced by Blackout kick.
On Mistweaver, RSK can do a burst of healing and extend the duraiton of your HOTs.
On Brewmaster: RSK does nothing. just use it every few seconds.","Nov 18, 2022 6:41 am",Monk
It should be removed from brewmaster because button bloat is bad enough.,"Nov 18, 2022 8:26 am",Monk
We need RSK because it is our strongest single-target attack. It would be great if there was some synergy with other abilities instead of just having it on cooldown.,"Nov 18, 2022 12:14 pm",Monk
It would be great if it synergized with the talent (forget the name) that adds double damage to blackout kick and spinning crane kick as fire damage.,"Nov 18, 2022 12:24 pm",Monk
Remove the dash to target aspect of this ability for the love of god. This talent (in every build) makes this class unplayable. At least make a glyph or something that allows you to remove this aspect of the talent.,"Nov 17, 2022 3:57 am",Monk
Curious to know what you mean by it being unplayable? I don’t main MW but I do enjoy the little dash and think it’s really fun when I do play it.,"Nov 17, 2022 11:56 am",Monk
"Did anyone play test Skyreach? What? You do realize that Skyreach is based off of a SL leggo, right? It’s literally a copy/paste. How much more play testing do you think it needs?","Nov 17, 2022 1:59 pm",Monk
"Obviously not a PVP player. Skyreach -dash to target- is a staple carry over mechanic. The gap closer mechanic is part of what makes this talent choice so powerful. You PVE peeps can keep your statues, please leave Skyreach alone.","Nov 18, 2022 9:00 am",Monk
"Does the bonus fire damage I get from charred passions that enhances Blackout Kick and Spinning Crane Kick count as magic damage? Does the Chi Wave/Chi Burst, Eye of the Tiger, and Crackling Jade Lightning count as magic damage? Does the shadow damage from Bonedust blew count as magic damage?","Nov 14, 2022 12:31 pm",Monk
"What I’m asking is, does elemental damage from monk considered magic damage?","Nov 17, 2022 11:47 am",Monk
I know most races aren’t much better than others and if they are it’s marginal but I’m looking between orc and troll so I just was curious if anyone had a recommendation. that’s all. If so it would be very helpful. Thank you for any feedback I also heard that they nerfed the orc racial or rather they are giving everyone in dragon flight something similar or basically like the orc racial. I haven’t played orc before so I might be wrong on that but regardless any feedback would be greatly appreciated,"Nov 15, 2022 1:40 am",Monk
Also if there’s a recommended race that far out shines orcs And trolls then I’d be happy to hear any info on that. thank you very much!!,"Nov 15, 2022 4:58 am",Monk
Tauren will always be a good option for classes that stack critical strike. The aoe stun is also really strong aoe stop in M+.,"Nov 15, 2022 12:03 pm",Monk
"Racials really don’t matter, unless you plan to pvp, then maybe tauren or undead. I really love my ztroll (who started out as a troll, then went nightborne lol, but gift of paku is nice), but a lot of people prefer belf just for the animations (the purge is nice, too).","Nov 15, 2022 2:13 pm",Monk
"i have 3 monks on horde, undead main and leveling orc and belf atm, it all comes down to sounds, animations and cosmetics, i am not a fan of the undead armor with the twisted and skinny waste line anymore, this one is my main. i am loveing the gear look and the animations of the orc, i have personally never loved belf, play what looks and feels good.
Racials dont matter except in top 3 % of players in any content. although i do love will of forsaken and cannibalize.
With that said playing my zandi toons i do feel like i feel paku crit values, the blood fury from orc is something you can feel also. it def feels bad to get sick of a toon you love the class but hate the aesthetics off, ex: my darkspear troll i have mained since cata, just sick of looking at it, but i am also over mail armor lol","Nov 15, 2022 2:14 pm",Monk

i do love my panda priest,"Nov 16, 2022 10:33 am",Monk
I second this!,"Nov 16, 2022 11:12 pm",Monk
"I recently changed mine from Undead to Highmountain. I love it! Looks awesome when you do the rising kick, just phenomenal animations. Orc was my second option but I’m going to give highmountain a try for a while and if I get bored orc is next.","Nov 16, 2022 11:42 pm",Monk
I’m a fan of Vulpera,"Nov 17, 2022 10:40 am",Monk
"Remind me why we don’t have that back again? Basically every other leather wearer has two stuns. And honestly, it’s kinda annoying to not be able to burst cleanly.","Nov 17, 2022 1:50 am",Monk
"Para is more or less a close the distance spell/emergency kick, and people just trinket sweep. Ring is hit or miss.","Nov 17, 2022 1:58 am",Monk
We don’t have it back because they’re afraid of balancing it. They would have to rework the whole spec because we have CDR on Fists of Fury now which means we would have CDR on a short-CD AoE stun baked into our rotation which is pretty broken if left unmitigated.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:16 am",Monk
"That’s the reason, but I miss FoF stun just as much as you do and hope they bring it back somehow. The spec still doesn’t feel complete without it.","Nov 17, 2022 2:34 am",Monk
Devs- I have yet to see a logical explanation for the change to vivacious vivification. You stated that it is reducing the decision window- that basically it makes vivify the go-to in all situations. That it is infringing on soothing mist’s place in the toolkit.,"Sep 17, 2022 5:17 pm",Monk
"This simply isn’t the case. Even when vivify is the full 1.5s cast and not instant, there is only one situation in which I am going to use soothing mist to chain vivify a target- and that is when I need to throw three vivifies in a row on that target. In EVERY other situation, I am hard-casting vivify, because it is faster than chaining a 1.5s viv on top of a 1s soothing mist.","Sep 17, 2022 8:03 pm",Monk
"Beyond that, soothing mist just does not have a place in modern WoW. The emphasis has been on widepsread rot damage across the entire group. Soothing jade statue and soothing mist are a relic of the past that nobody uses and unless something huge changes in Dragonflight, it won’t be used there either.","Sep 17, 2022 10:09 pm",Monk
"Disclaimer: the content I play the most is mythic plus. I dabble in raiding (where vivify is hardly ever used at all) and I never PvP. I don’t think the nerf to vivacious vivification matters at all in raiding. I think it matters quite a bit in PvP, as healers are overpowered if they can never be interrupted. The talent may need to be disabled for PvP combat.","Sep 17, 2022 11:18 pm",Monk
"So, let’s look at mistweaaver.","Sep 18, 2022 12:47 am",Monk
The game engine treats it as melee. Mechanics that are applied to melee players are applied to mistweavers.,"Oct 23, 2022 8:16 pm",Monk
Let’s look at other melee players. Almost all of their abilities are instants. You don’t see any of them having to stand and plant to use their core abilities. They just swing and its an instant.,"Oct 25, 2022 2:26 pm",Monk
"Mistweavers have been making do with vivify in melee, but the cast becoming instant would be a very nice quality of life change. For storming affix, it would be HUGE. It’s hard enough to dodge regular melee mechanics, but when you need to get a vivify off, and you’re dodging tornadoes as well, it becomes nearly impossible.","Oct 26, 2022 9:57 pm",Monk
"So, you’re already incorrect on instant vivify harming the soothing mist spec, because soothing mist is already something that doesn’t even belong in the game.","Oct 27, 2022 10:00 am",Monk
"The problem at this point might be that you are trying to please a vocal minority of the mistweaver base who wants ranged mistweaving to be as viable as fistweaving. I don’t see a problem with doing that, but as I’ve already pointed out, the game is hardcoded to treat mistweavers as melee. Ranged weavers are fighting upstream right now.","Oct 27, 2022 10:45 pm",Monk
"Could you consider just splitting the spec into two? Monks might just need four specializations, like druids have.","Oct 28, 2022 9:36 am",Monk
"Regardless, instant vivify (in PvE) is a negligible throughput gain in that it just allows us to get a few more vivifies off where in the past we would have to cancel a cast to move and try casting again. Vivify has always been soft-capped by being a mana-intensive spell that if used too much will run you oom. Also, the GCD still applies- even as instant-cast, you cannot spam more vivifies than before, becuase the cast time is the same length as the GCD.","Nov 13, 2022 5:02 am",Monk
"Green priests just need to reroll to priest, the spec is hurting because they are trying to make it something its not.","Nov 15, 2022 12:11 pm",Monk
I think the devs are doing a better job with the MW tree than the HPAL tree at making both melee and ranged builds viable. I definitely understand and somewhat agree with the feeling that trying to make 2 very different playstyles viable in 1 tree will just weaken both. But I think the whole point of talent trees should be to give players different play style choices instead of just numbers choices. Choosing 5% crit vs 5% haste is boring.,"Nov 15, 2022 1:26 pm",Monk
"So i guess PvP Monks gotta go touch grass? Fist Weaving does not work in the slightest in PvP. Yulon at least can get some healing done since it isn’t chasing people with 10 million disengages/speed boosts like Chiji. I don’t mind fist weaving in PvE because it is the only one viable that doesn’t OOM us and the only one that does damage. But in PvP, it is a death wish.

I have noticed that the Skyreach talent at the bottom of the Windwalker tree has been causing a lot of issues lately and wanted to see if it was the same for others.,"Nov 16, 2022 5:30 pm",Monk
"This talent causes you to teleport a short distance when using Tiger Palm. I’ve noticed that when I am standing at the edge of a hit box of a mob, I can still melee the mob and use other abilities where I’m standing. Once I use Tiger Palm, it teleports me forward, towards the mob even though I’m in melee range. This has caused me to die multiple times in M+ because I was on the edge of a pool or some mechanic, and it teleports me toward the mob I’m attacking, causing me to enter the mechanic I’m trying to avoid. I can’t cut Tiger Palm out of my rotation, so I guess the next step would just to be not to use Skyreach even if it is a great DPS increase.","Nov 16, 2022 8:16 pm",Monk

"Several great talents are locked behind summoning Xuen, but more importantly, behind talents that rely on Summoning Xuen even if you dont talent into summoning him. Xuen’s Bond(Xuen cooldown reduction and Xuen base damage increase) and Empowered Tiger Lightning(more Xuen damage based off of your damage) block several talents that have no need for summoning Xuen.
Xuen’s Battlegear(increased crit chance for Rising Sun Kick after full channel of Fists of Fury, and RSK crits reduce FoF cooldown), Skyreach(Tiger Palm dash and crit chance increase), Last Emperors Capacitor(Crackling Jade Lightning nuke), and Transfer the Power(Blackout Kick and Rising Sun Kick increasing Fists of Fury damage) are all locked behind these abilites, or having to pick Summoning Xuen.
Even Fury of Xuen(FoF has chance to summon Xuen and increase haste) is locked behind Summoning Xuen, but I find it perfecttly acceptable if Xuen was sumoned for a brief time off of FoF even if you dont have the talent to Summon Xuen directly(although just getting the haste buff and no Xuen would be better in my opinion.)
I really dislike summoning a pet as a monk, and having some really cool talents and possible talent combinations locked behind Xuen, and also two dead talents if you dont take Xuen, such a waste.
Personally what i find really fun is the crit FoF build. Getting a huge RSK crit chance after FoF, plus the Skyreach crit chance leads to drastic FoF cooldown reduction. And with possible haste reducing FoF channel time(which i wish there was more of. 4 sec channeling FoF is such a long time without being able to interrupt, use a movement ability, or run out of range.","Oct 1, 2022 4:14 am",Monk
"If they swapped positions of “empowered tiger lightning” with “fury of xuen” (row 8-3 and row 8-4) this problem would resolve itself. You could choose to forgo the Xuen talent and only take a chance to randomly proc him. This means that you wouldn’t be buffing an ability you don’t have, instead giving you a random chance to proc that ability without speccing into it.
I too would like to create a build without Xuen, but happy for him to randomly proc without my control as a compomise so I can reach the talents I actually like.","Oct 3, 2022 1:35 am",Monk
I mentioned this same frustration in another post but it has improved since then.,"Oct 3, 2022 6:36 pm",Monk
"You would have to replace both Empowered Tiger Lightning and Xuen’s Bond because both of those nodes are the alternate path to Xuen and it makes no sense have Xuen-centric abilities there. I suggest pushing the abilities that have nothing to do with Xuen to those nodes and having the direct line down from Xuen be fixated on augmenting Xuen. For example, Keefers, Transfer the Power, Xuen’s Battlegear and Emperors Capacitor all make more sense and mean that you can avoid taking Xuen without being punished by having to select nodes that improve him.","Oct 4, 2022 12:30 am",Monk

Empowered Tiger Lightning shouldn’t be a talent to begin with. Just bake it back into Xuen like it is now. Xuen’s Bond shouldn’t exist in its current form.

And Invoker’s and Fury of Xuen should honestly be fused since they have very similar interactions with Xuen.,"Oct 5, 2022 12:16 am",Monk

Am I missing something here. Doesn’t our MW mastery only affect cast spells and not bonus healing from damage attacks? Perhaps an overhaul is in order to better work with all aspects of the class?,"Nov 15, 2022 1:00 pm",Monk
ya… mastery is pretty much useless for FW… you still get Gusts from throwing out your Renewing Mists and the occassional Vivify but ya… not even mediocre for FW,"Nov 15, 2022 1:05 pm",Monk
What are you talking about? Chi-ji is our main cooldown and works almost entirely off of Mastery. We will be running a decent amount of Mas in DF M+,"Nov 15, 2022 1:05 pm",Monk
It still provides great burst healing on 1min cooldown windows by benefiting from Chi-ji summons. And the Gusts of Mists heal that comes with the instant Enveloping Mist after doing a TOTM combo with Chi-Ji out.,"Nov 15, 2022 1:25 pm",Monk
It also helps add extra burst healing from using your 2 Renewing Mists on injured allies then spending your instant Vivify on a 3rd injured person.,"Nov 15, 2022 1:35 pm",Monk
"Going into DF it will be different. but throughout all of SL mastery was nigh useless as a FW. (I played both FW and MW styles in SL)
I didn’t like Chi-ji through SL, use RJW instead, may take it for DF, see how that plays out. more options now for sure, and easier to switch (no need for tomes, or hearthing to change covenants.) But on its own. Mastery really doesn’t do much for FW (aka healing through AoTM)","Nov 15, 2022 2:02 pm",Monk
"Mastery was only considered a “bad” stat in SL because it did nothing for our damage and MW could cover the healer checks without grabbing additional Mastery. Haste/Crit were better in those seasons because it did contribute to damage dealt. SL s2/s3 was all about healer damage mainly because there was minimal healer checks and even the ones that did exist, were not very challenging.","Nov 15, 2022 2:07 pm",Monk

Healing is very awkward on MW when you need burst. MW requires you to be setup 24/7 for any mistakes or big healing moments. Most people found this when doing Ruby first boss. I watched a lot of content creators fall flat on their face because they couldn’t keep up with the damage or they can’t play the spec very well.
