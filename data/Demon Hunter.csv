"Demon Hunter
Immolation Aura now deals reduced damage beyond 8 targets.
Havoc
Fel Rush now deals reduced damage beyond 5 targets.
Unboundchaos be useles?","Nov 19, 2022 10:03 am",Demon Hunter
I think these nerfs have been long overdue. We spent a good majority of SL playing Fel Rush and Immo Aura for AoE and it’s always been disproportionate to what many specs struggle to output.,"Nov 19, 2022 1:39 pm",Demon Hunter
"Unbound Chaos, like Momentum, should either be part of a different DPS spec or should be deleted. Movement for damage is toxic. I celebrate these nerfs.","Nov 19, 2022 4:17 pm",Demon Hunter
"Is the momentum style nerfed down to where its not going to be near mandatory now? I really like vengeance for dungeons and want to main the class after returning to wow, however i hate momentum for havoc and is really putting me off making this my main.","Nov 19, 2022 12:32 pm",Demon Hunter
"Momentum is a talent that buffs the entire toolkit, not just Fel Rush and Immo Aura. If you are going to use abilities as Havoc then you will still want to take Momentum. It’s that simple.","Nov 19, 2022 1:31 pm",Demon Hunter
"I was hoping with the changes, another build would make you not pick it anymore. Shows how much i know about DH.","Nov 19, 2022 1:36 pm",Demon Hunter
A flat damage increase is super hard to go without. Do you know if any of the other builds are close in damage?,"Nov 19, 2022 1:44 pm",Demon Hunter
Thanks for clarifying.,"Nov 19, 2022 2:15 pm",Demon Hunter
"Unfortunately because of where Momentum is situated on the talent tree it’s really difficult not to take it. Initiative and KYE are two of our most powerful talents, you’ll be hard-pressed to create any kind of build that can compete that foregoes those two in particular. Momentum is just a talent you’d pick up within the column of talents between those two, it’s a choice between that and Chaos Theory, which, given how particular the advatnage of Chaos Theory is compared to how general the one from Momentum is there isn’t really much choice at all (or you can have both!)","Nov 19, 2022 4:16 pm",Demon Hunter
What happened to it?,"Nov 2, 2022 7:38 pm",Demon Hunter
"Mortal Dance was and has always been a PVP talent.
On the beta it was added as a talent in the Havoc spec tree and as of yesterday, it was available to get as a PVP talent or in the spec tree.
Today, and without warning, it has been removed as a PVP talent and you can only select it in the spec tree…","Nov 2, 2022 9:00 pm",Demon Hunter
What gives??,"Nov 2, 2022 9:30 pm",Demon Hunter
Still there for me. On live should I say,"Nov 2, 2022 9:35 pm",Demon Hunter
As a PVP talent?,"Nov 2, 2022 9:50 pm",Demon Hunter
Yes my guy,"Nov 2, 2022 10:53 pm",Demon Hunter
"I’ll have to triple check then.
Weird. It wasn’t there earlier today on Beta or Live.","Nov 2, 2022 11:46 pm",Demon Hunter
Yeah I double check it’s there,"Nov 3, 2022 9:01 am",Demon Hunter
Yup. I only logged onto Live once today and it was gone. Now it’s back again. Man… idk,"Nov 3, 2022 10:17 am",Demon Hunter
"Mortal Dance and Demonic Origins are in the list of pvp talents, and work, but do not stak, is just silly XD","Nov 3, 2022 2:29 pm",Demon Hunter
"They are only here until the end of the prepatch. As soon as the new expansion kicks in, they are gone from pvp talents.","Nov 3, 2022 4:06 pm",Demon Hunter
Where did you see this? I don’t believe this is the case. They’re intended to not stack.,"Nov 4, 2022 5:41 am",Demon Hunter
"I’m also curious. If that’s the case, it’s fine… I’ve already updated my talent tree as such, but it’s just weird.","Nov 7, 2022 4:01 pm",Demon Hunter
I’m not on beta but on fel hammer they mentioned that whatever is on talent tree is gone from pvp talents on Dragon isles client. I don’t know if anyone can hop and confirm,"Nov 7, 2022 4:03 pm",Demon Hunter
"the bigger problem is that it doesn’t always work in pvp when selected in the tree. I used to use it in pvp selection but when saw it in the tree I was excited so I could take a different PVP talent. but it wasn’t putting the purple debuff on anything. Then on the dummy it was, but not on players and even reloaded the game. But if I choose it as a pvp talent it works. I reported it as a bug. Explore and report this if you find as well. I was getting into fights with classes that could heal and couldn’t beat them when taken from the tree, but then as a pvp talent it was easier. Then I had noticed this","Nov 9, 2022 5:08 pm",Demon Hunter
"Also Immolation doesn’t remove stuff even if you specced it , in pvp. Still stacked up by warlocks…another jackass bug","Nov 9, 2022 7:23 pm",Demon Hunter
I saw this the other day when testing and reported it as a bug.,"Nov 11, 2022 6:03 pm",Demon Hunter
"not sure why is been move to the three, doesnt really make sense","Nov 12, 2022 4:28 pm",Demon Hunter
"Yes, Mortal Dance and First of the Illidari are now in the tree only and have been removed as PVP talents.","Nov 12, 2022 10:04 pm",Demon Hunter
sad they are making us waste a talent tree points instead having it on the pvp talents =(,"Nov 12, 2022 10:09 pm",Demon Hunter
It feels so miserable having to spend a spec talent to get our ms.,"Nov 19, 2022 3:15 pm",Demon Hunter
After playing dracthyr and being able to shoot up in the sky with soar i wanted it for my DH even more.,"Nov 18, 2022 10:55 pm",Demon Hunter
I kept getting excited when i would see a quest marker hundreds of yards away and knew i was going to get to use soar to travel there. It was hitting the class fantasy in the right place.,"Nov 19, 2022 8:32 am",Demon Hunter
Not only is it super impactful for class fantasy but it is so fun.,"Nov 19, 2022 8:55 am",Demon Hunter
It feels bad getting back on my DH and being able to glide like Dracthyr but not soar.,"Nov 19, 2022 10:04 am",Demon Hunter
"Im not saying to do it right away, i know they want to drive excitement around the new race but if it could be an eventuality that was be","Nov 19, 2022 11:59 am",Demon Hunter
"Also, Illidan flies all the time so we know its possible for a DH to do it.","Nov 19, 2022 12:12 pm",Demon Hunter
"Also, while i have you… customizable demon forms.","Nov 19, 2022 1:13 pm",Demon Hunter
Actually a bit surprised once soar came out S an ability that DH wasn’t given the ability as well.,"Nov 19, 2022 1:29 pm",Demon Hunter
yeah…“The Hunt” … supposed to do 6k dmg hit me for 60k.,"Nov 8, 2022 3:43 pm",Demon Hunter
i wont make an exhaustive list…you all know haha.,"Nov 8, 2022 4:12 pm",Demon Hunter
prepatch goodness,"Nov 8, 2022 4:13 pm",Demon Hunter
6k isn’t taking into account their stats. My dh in 285 pvp gear has a tooltip of 13500 and then 14500 dot.,"Nov 8, 2022 9:10 pm",Demon Hunter
There’s a talent that converts arcane dmg to chaos dmg which would increase that by mastery %. So that and a crit would make sense for 60k dmg.,"Nov 8, 2022 10:07 pm",Demon Hunter
60k over 6 seconds (hit + dot) but my ele shaman can set up triple lava burst in single cast and adding in overloads will be about 60k as well.,"Nov 14, 2022 4:29 pm",Demon Hunter
"right, well i think some classes need a bit of tuning regardless of your explanation. DH is insane RN","Nov 14, 2022 9:09 pm",Demon Hunter
Dh for me was the bane of my existence as well before playing it and learning it. Just keep them stunned and slowed and they flip. Just like dk that can’t get on people and can’t death strike just flop over.,"Nov 15, 2022 12:52 pm",Demon Hunter
I hit a guy for 87k in solo shuffle earlier. 41% crit un buffed. 307 ilvl. Momentum+Fodder+initiative+on use trinket+dark archangel. Can’t forget KYE talent. I don’t spec into the increased dot damage because odds are you’re dying if I hit you for 87k (it’s usually mid 70s I don’t always have dark arch buff of course) in a GCD. On the low end is 60k really,"Nov 19, 2022 12:47 pm",Demon Hunter
"I love mine, so I’m keeping her. I’ll roll with whatever punches come my way. How about you?","Sep 1, 2022 12:37 am",Demon Hunter
DH will always be there for me if i need it. A good fallback.,"Sep 1, 2022 1:24 am",Demon Hunter
"But ima try Evoker in dragonflight, it looks fun, i still get horns, and i can still glide. Heyoo!","Sep 1, 2022 10:53 am",Demon Hunter
"Also i look at their talent tree and see several builds i might enjoy, as opposed to DH where there is only one, and it’s stressful to wonder whether the only playstyle you enjoy is going to be poop or not every tier. Like i’ve been doing this entire expansion.","Sep 1, 2022 10:58 am",Demon Hunter
"I love my DH and ima keep playing him, I have… “Faith” that Blizzard will improve on the talent trees, but the general lack of communication thus far with just Shadowlands in particular is unforgivable. Were bottom of the S4 overall… And yet, we still don’t get it addressed, hell were second to bottom on the boss list? I think? Either way, it needs something, because the higher the gear level everyone gets, the further behind we get, and this is not fair to us.","Sep 1, 2022 11:01 am",Demon Hunter
"Interesting. Not that I raid, personally. However, the Icy Veins rankings for season 4 DPS list Havoc as 9, out of 24.","Sep 1, 2022 11:12 am",Demon Hunter
"Where is that graph from, and do we know which is correct. For that matter, do we even know if those particular DH’s were trying or afk-ing?","Sep 1, 2022 11:14 am",Demon Hunter
that came straight from Icy-Veins front page,"Sep 1, 2022 11:18 am",Demon Hunter
"That’s weird. The one on their dedicated page is different. I can’t post links, so append this to the base url…","Sep 1, 2022 11:48 am",Demon Hunter
/wow/dps-rankings-tier-list,"Sep 1, 2022 11:52 am",Demon Hunter
Rank changes depending on the players you review.,"Sep 1, 2022 12:25 pm",Demon Hunter
Against Heroic and Mythic wanna be guilds/players we show better because the person playing makes a difference more than class/spec.,"Sep 1, 2022 1:11 pm",Demon Hunter
"When you isolate the review to only the top percentage of players, assuming that top DPS = top play, we see that given the same full on effort that Havoc’s kit doesn’t keep up.","Sep 2, 2022 9:30 am",Demon Hunter
Warlocks ain’t at the top because they’re played by teen age prodigies.,"Sep 2, 2022 11:41 am",Demon Hunter
"I try to play other, better classes but I can’t put DH down. It’s the most fun I’ve had in the game in so long. I don’t care if I’d be better playing Blood instead of Veng, anything instead of Havoc, DH is my passion… And now they’re doing all these changes, bringing back old things I loved, make combinations I couldn’t before. Seems like things are gonna liven up!","Sep 2, 2022 3:53 pm",Demon Hunter
"Season 1-3 this class was omega bad. Maybe the worst (not talking about pvp).
S4 - it’s hands down THE WORST.
And clownZZARD barely touched it for the WHOLE addon.
Random in everything, astronomical cd, no burst, AOE CAP XDDDDDDDDDD.","Sep 2, 2022 5:29 pm",Demon Hunter
Soooo… yeaaahhh…,"Sep 2, 2022 6:34 pm",Demon Hunter
Keep your hopes high but don’t expect much.,"Sep 3, 2022 6:27 pm",Demon Hunter
If it’s bad in beta 10.0 - it’s a big chance it will be bad till the end of time.,"Sep 3, 2022 10:40 pm",Demon Hunter
"But, yet again, if you don’t raid at all - I meeeeaaannn… like… do whatever…, no?","Sep 6, 2022 7:47 pm",Demon Hunter
"Looks like now we have to choose between it and demonic as a talent (on beta, at least). Not a fan. Those two talents complement each other way too well to be separate by a node choice. Obviously our damage was a bit out of hand, but idk if this was the answer over just some tuning.","Nov 8, 2022 8:24 pm",Demon Hunter
It’s a trade off node.,"Nov 8, 2022 9:08 pm",Demon Hunter
"You can have frequent, but shorter power windows through demonic along with baseline Meta, or you can shorten the Cooldown with added +vers.","Nov 8, 2022 9:13 pm",Demon Hunter
It’s just a decision between the two. You don’t get to have both.,"Nov 8, 2022 10:33 pm",Demon Hunter
Re-read my post. We DID get to have both prior to this build via a pvp talent that was unfortunately just removed.,"Nov 8, 2022 10:50 pm",Demon Hunter
"And you’ll note from my response, I have not argued that…","Nov 9, 2022 12:18 am",Demon Hunter
"As it is now in pre-patch, it is a choice between the two.","Nov 9, 2022 12:35 am",Demon Hunter
"You’ll just have to choose, and no longer have access to both.","Nov 9, 2022 10:47 am",Demon Hunter
No it’s not. I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall.,"Nov 9, 2022 12:26 pm",Demon Hunter
"As it is now in pre-patch, you can get both abilities. You can take the demonic talent and the First of the Illidari pvp talent at the same time.","Nov 9, 2022 12:49 pm",Demon Hunter
"That is no longer an option on the beta. If it goes live, it’s a pretty massive change. Assuming we take the demonic talent, it effectively nerfs our burst damage by 10% and increases our meta cd by a minute.","Nov 9, 2022 12:56 pm",Demon Hunter
"Of all the incredibly dumb things to cry about on the forum, this might be the dumbest. If you can build to a higher meta uptime then the class will be balanced around you doing precisely that. What will be a personal preference for you will be mandatory for everyone else because we’ll be severely underpowered if we don’t combo First/Demonic.","Nov 10, 2022 1:20 am",Demon Hunter
This is like the Momentum discourse but somehow even more boneheaded.,"Nov 10, 2022 4:51 am",Demon Hunter
"Nobody’s crying. I was just surprised that a massive unannounced nerf like this just wasn’t being talked about at all and figured I’d mention it. But I didn’t realize that people on the dh forums apparently just don’t like talking about big dh changes. So that’s on me, I guess.","Nov 10, 2022 5:22 am",Demon Hunter
Those of us actively keeping up on the Alpha/Beta were aware this was going to occur months ago.,"Nov 10, 2022 7:04 am",Demon Hunter
"With the large majority not engaging in PvP, this reduction in power wasn’t really at the core of discussions. Primarily the discussion was around PvE and how First isn’t nearly equal to Demonic.","Nov 10, 2022 8:56 am",Demon Hunter
Why would you be surprised First/Demonic isn’t going to be viable? They already share a choice node. The fact that one has persisted as a PvP talent in spite of this should be indication enough that that’s an oversight. Nevermind how broken an excessively high meta uptime DH build would be.,"Nov 10, 2022 3:15 pm",Demon Hunter
I can’t understand why anyone would be surprised by this - especially given how well DH is performing regardless.,"Nov 10, 2022 11:39 pm",Demon Hunter
"I assumed it too. But the months went by, and it never went away. At this point, literally all our impressions about how dh performs in pvp on live and on the beta are based on this talent. So its removal, surprising or not, is a pretty massive deal. One that almost nobody knows just happened.","Nov 11, 2022 12:37 am",Demon Hunter
I’m not surprised. In the same way I won’t be surprised when they eventually gut/overhaul fodder to the flame. But it’ll still be a big deal and people should know if/when it happens. You’re 100% right that this discourse is pretty boneheaded. Why you being so annoying with these dumb responses?,"Nov 13, 2022 10:44 am",Demon Hunter
Is anyone having this issue? Throw Glaive just won’t work. I missed out on a rare kill because of it,"Nov 18, 2022 12:44 am",Demon Hunter
"ive just experience this, it appears to behave for me at least by working only when i am in combat, ie cannot start combat using throw glaive.","Nov 18, 2022 3:46 am",Demon Hunter
I will test it out today to see if it works for me and will let you know,"Nov 18, 2022 6:51 am",Demon Hunter

"We had classes like WW and Enhancement get the ol nerf bat. I have a dh, and its fun, but its over the top right now. They need a little nip to how much dang dmg they are doing. Pre patch or not. Lot of their abilities are hitting too hard and way too fast, healing wise, heals cannot save anyone from that kind of damage and its pretty game breaking.","Nov 16, 2022 10:22 pm",Demon Hunter

Absolutely right. BUFF DH @ 70!!,"Nov 17, 2022 7:08 pm",Demon Hunter
"By the way, you post on your main Hunter to nerf your alt DH because you are salty of getting owned by other DH’s… sounds like a Hunter problem.","Nov 17, 2022 7:35 pm",Demon Hunter
"This isnt my main, lol, you just dont want to be nerfed and want to be op. Instead of having a fair fight.","Nov 17, 2022 7:39 pm",Demon Hunter
Bro. The game is now balanced around level 70. All you people are doing is showing that you’re braindead. You’re essentially whining about twinks in pvp at under max level.,"Nov 17, 2022 7:44 pm",Demon Hunter
"They are still too strong at 70, been in a bg lately? Tons of dhs… if enhance and ww got nerfs, they need um too. Hell evoker needs um too!","Nov 17, 2022 9:18 pm",Demon Hunter
I’ve been on the beta the entirety of beta. DH is not even close to the biggest problem. Actually I’d say the real problem with DH is that it’s so easy to kill with a single CC outside of it’s cooldowns. Maybe you’re just bad?,"Nov 18, 2022 11:49 am",Demon Hunter
But if your not CCd your doing 3 times everyone else’s damage. With a solid team rotate trinkets and defensives and DH is a god.,"Nov 18, 2022 1:45 pm",Demon Hunter

"Don’t get me wrong, I love when Dh is super duper op, but I have lots of concerns that DH doesn’t take much skill to play right now. I’m worried that if it stays like this, were going to get nerfed for being such a strong class while not having much skill.","Nov 5, 2022 7:45 pm",Demon Hunter

Love Momentum TBH. It’s one of the few talents/spells that gives you a risk/reward playstyle alongside Surrender to Madness and Ravenous Frenzy. Except it’s not as hardcore as either of those abilities to the point where you can choose to sacrifice some of your output in specific parts of a fight/Key so that you retain your mobility and can still do/avoid mechanics.,"Sep 30, 2022 11:33 pm",Demon Hunter
"There are some players who don’t want Momentum to be super spammy with the incoming reduction to the Fel Rush CD with Erratic Felheart. But IMO that’s more of an issue with Erratic Felheart as opposed to momentum. Besides that, Momentum acts exactly the same as it does currently on live.","Sep 30, 2022 11:43 pm",Demon Hunter
"Then there are players who, for the most part, do not do competitive content enough to worry about whether the sub 5% damage amp really affects them in any way. Added to that, they probably have never tried momentum to attempt at any challenging content in a dedicated manner.","Oct 1, 2022 10:20 am",Demon Hunter
"I think people just want to minimize risk when they’re playing DH. Some of us get bored though and like the added complexity. It’s like a more involved rotation but it involves map awareness rather than making silly combos.

Essence Break is incredible for 1 shot scenarios.

You still have Hunt in this build 9/10 times and it hits like a truck without having to rely on if you crit (Essence break play style needs high crit I play at 40%) or not.
