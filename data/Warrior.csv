"PVE: We got nerfed a month ago, Fury is superior for PVE yet again (been waiting 4 years to play arms again, skipped Shadowlands arms bc shadowlands… missed when it was strong)","Nov 14, 2022 5:33 pm",Warrior
Pvp: health pool increase for players 40% with no arms buff? Arms is a burst class not only will everyone have max lv pvp gear (increased hp pool) but also the player health buff is a huge nerf to bursty pvp arms warrior. So yet again we Warriors will be forced Fury again! Oh boi! I can’t wait to smash my raging blow button 8x more than my other buttons… other buttons being 2 buttons. Geeee so glad I never get to play my main arms warrior in pve/pvp. I’ll just be a meme and not get invited to groups b/c this company has no balance or hindsight when iterating changes. So tired of this! At least I’ll have more fun healing on my alt bc of the changes.,"Nov 15, 2022 12:26 am",Warrior
I was so excited to play Arms after levelling it to 70 in beta after maining Outlaw for like 90% of Shadowlands.,"Nov 15, 2022 4:23 am",Warrior
"Can’t really justify changing mains now, it’s really that bad as Arms.","Nov 15, 2022 2:01 pm",Warrior
"I’m just disappointed with recent changes.
You can still perform well on it and the spec it’s self is sooo fun! You can clear all content on it. However, with Fury being technically superior in mythic+/raiding/pvp that’s the ideal spec to play. It’s hard to justify maining arms…
Some groups may decline and opt for something else or may only take a fury over an arms (depends on the group)
Anyways, play what your better at, enjoy more, & will perform better with! But gosh darn do I hope my favorite spec Arms gets some love and buffs.","Nov 19, 2022 10:12 am",Warrior
I’m really perplexed behind the design decision behind making fury bursty and making arms a weird obsolete mess. It was always that fury was the sustained damage/healing PvE spec and Arms was high damage burst with a lot of utility and toolkit for many situations.,"Nov 19, 2022 11:46 am",Warrior
"The recent two expansions theres a huge disconnect between the gear I’m equipping and what’s translated on screen. A two hander in melee combat should hit the hardest. I guess that’s why classic is so popular, you still feel that connection.","Nov 19, 2022 5:33 pm",Warrior
"Disclaimer: this build works better than standard SMF, but I cannot rate it compared to Reckless Abandon TG Crushing Blow due to lack of data and ability to test. Every meta lord with years of retail experience has already determined that TG is the best, probably with Reckless Abandon because Crushing Blow, a rage generator, effectively hits harder than an 80 rage spendor, it’s bonkers. This build with daggers is probably going to be less dps than what warriors with years of theory crafting experience have figured out. I’m coming in with 2 weeks of retail experience because I stopped playing when talent trees were removed and now that they’re back, fun build diversity has a chance of existing and I’m here to take fun builds as far as they can go! It’s long shot, but this build has a possibility of being meta!?","Aug 15, 2022 10:00 pm",Warrior
"Daggers are only 5.5% AP behind Strength 1 handers. It’s laughably easy to make up for that deficit (see post 33 for AP math). Remember I’m only comparing daggers to 1 handers for SMF, Not Meta TG, I don’t have the data for that, yet. And now that disclaimers are out of the way, the actual post (revision, oh god, 15?)","Aug 15, 2022 11:02 pm",Warrior
"Introducing DAGGERS! Which now work with all fury abilities and talents. Why Daggers? You get 35% more auto attack rage with using daggers with annihilator than you do with standard 2.6 speed Single Minded Fury Weapons and a hilarious amount more rage than Titan’s Grip. Y’know how standard Single Minded Fury builds are bloodthirsting every other GCD and occasionally running out of buttons to press? Throw that ideology in the garbage because you’re going to be RAMPAGING EVERY OTHER GCD. You stabby stab A LOT and pop recklessness every 27 seconds, leading to easily 100% recklessness uptime and ~45% Avatar uptime. Now 45% avatar uptime SOUNDS GREAT! And it is! When compared to standard Strength 1 hander SMF, the extra recklessness and avatar uptime probably translates to 2-8% more dps, which starts to make up for that 5.5% ap loss!","Aug 15, 2022 11:02 pm",Warrior
"It is right! Using Slam or Bloodthirst, you only end up losing about 11 rage per 1.7 second Rampage->[Bloodthirst OR slam] Cycle. You single handedly make up for 3.625 Rampage->[Bloodthirst Or Slam] cycles with ONE use of onslaught. And you’re popping onslaught every 10 seconds. Meaning if you get just 3 Sudden Death Procs Per Minute, you have enough rage to keep Rampaging every other attack, forever. You can see my math on this down in post 22, based off haste values I could get on a fresh 60 with not perfectly optimized 260 gear. Basically, if you can hit just 37% character sheet haste on average (include the average haste provided by the new weapon procs!), without including Frenzy/Enrage haste, you can Rampage every other attack forever. With the Tier set bonus providing more sudden death procs, we’ll probably be seeing enough rage to hit rage cap and relatively sometimes press Rampage more than once every other attack, but doing this without a frothing berskerer proc is hard, unless you’re -ugh- a gnome, because you’re regularly going to be just five rage short of being able to Rampage->Rampage at 130 rage without a frothing berserker proc and 100% GCD usage.","Aug 15, 2022 11:03 pm",Warrior
"Also, because of the 44% faster attack speed, you’ll have 44% more Slaughtering Strikes stacks on your Rampage! And since you’re using it every other GCD, you’ll never waste potential stacks going above 5! This is worth at least a 2% rampage damage increase, possibly 3-5%.","Aug 15, 2022 11:05 pm",Warrior
"Now lets look at standard strength weapon Single Minded Fury builds. I’m hearing they have to Bloodthirst every global cooldown just to have enough buttons to press or they spend time twiddling their thumbs waiting for things to come off the GCD. Bloodthirst is terrible, even with 10% increase damage talents it’s only 79% of your AP! That’s like HALF of Rampage!! Garbage, other than maybe the bleed applies, which is primarily used in AoE settings. Even if you were to spec Reckless abandon and give get Bloodbath instead, it’s only 110% ap, still garbage. Oh ""it gets faster cooldown and can be used to put more bleeds up quickly! Who Cares! After a whirlwind, we can still Rampage->Bloodthirst->Rampage->Bloodthirst. EZ PZ for better effect, we can almost always fit 2 rampages in the 4 charges after a whirlwind, that’s a lot more damage and we still easily put up two bloodthirsts to get them bleeds rolling. With the forever 20% Crit from recklessness, we bleed all the things!","Aug 15, 2022 11:42 pm",Warrior
"You lose up to 5.5% damage per hit and gain 44% more hits. ~35% increase in damage before even considering other factors like increased recklessness/avatar uptime making up for a lot of that 5.5% damage loss. Oh and the rage gain? Factoring in the same rage from white hits, Daggers will get about 35% more rage from auto attacks thanks to annihilator. This is why with daggers we can Rampage every other attack, and one handers can’t.","Aug 15, 2022 11:50 pm",Warrior
"No, not without SOME MORE DISCLAIMERS. Yep, fury warrior players get REALLY MAD when you doing anything other than talk about Titan’s Grip. It’s like they take this whole rage based gameplay and apply it to real life. So, with that said, the following spec has a bunch of filler/flex talents and some of the thoughts on it are not finalized. Everyone is expecting bleeds to be amazing and they’re probably right. So I’m going to link two specs, the “probably right spec” (for… daggers…) and the even more risky spec that relies on even harder speculation, but has a higher chance of somehow being good.","Aug 16, 2022 9:09 am",Warrior
"Yeah, I know, it’s hard to believe that an annihilator build wouldn’t go Dancing Blades being auto attack focused and all, but Onslaught scales way better with haste and provides almost twice the rage gain, it’s not even close. That being said, there’s a possibility that the damage gain from Dancing blade might be worth, but I doubt it cuz Onslaught still SLAPS. Maybe in… Dagger warrior PvP? dies of arena cringe","Aug 16, 2022 9:19 am",Warrior
"Now this spec, this spec is JUICY. It gets all of the execute talents, which should combo with our set bonus. It takes ~3 executes per 45 seconds to equal the damage loss of not having Odyn’s Fury and doesn’t really get better until you get 4 executes per 45 seconds.","Aug 16, 2022 9:29 am",Warrior
"Spear of Bastion is kinda just a hail mary for rage gen, it might suck and 2 points in Thunderous Roar might be better. The on demand +80 rage sounds good after a Back-to-Back Rampage->Rampage cycle though and if we get to a point where we can start to push Back-to-Back Rampages more frequently, the +80 rage is a nice way to smooth out deficits. Now that our only bleed is coming from Bloodthirst, it probably makes sense to swap to Blood Craze to something like Bloodborne, for more Bloodthirst Crits rather than more Bleed Damage. With Whirlwind having a larger rage deficit than Bloodthirst/slam, (15-19 vs 11), the extra rage from Spear of Bastion might somehow make for better AoE DPS than Thunderous Roar. I’m not 70, I can’t test it, I could be wrong and feel free to correct me, if you can actually go out and test it, with daggers. Otherwise, shut up, I’ve already stated it might not be better, it’s just worth thinking about.","Aug 16, 2022 9:50 am",Warrior
"How are you going to get daggers if you don’t have a rogue friend to trade you their hard earned drops? Actually, EASY! but EXPENSIVE and/or a HUGE TIME INVESTMENT
This is how I’m getting a dagger:","Aug 18, 2022 6:43 am",Warrior
"(link description for those not feeling clicky, It’s link to a Blacksmithing profession tree with 150 knowledge point spent to craft mythic tier daggers)
Blacksmithing is a source of Mythic Quality weapons, but it’s expensive, resource limited, and possibly a complete waste of time. Though if this build doesn’t work out, I hope to be one of the only idiots who maxed daggers so hard, maybe I’ll be able to make a buck?","Aug 18, 2022 7:17 am",Warrior
"Yeah, so I’ve been focusing on getting SO MANY RAMPAGES, you’d think it’d be amazing right? Well if you spec Reckless Abandon: Crushing Blows, if you include the slaughter strike benefit as part of Crushing Blow’s damage, it hits harder than rampage and they’re a RAGE GENERATOR. Standard Reckless Abandon Titan’s Grip can already almost keep up a cycle of Rampage->Crushing Blow->Crushing Blow and then repeat. Maybe cast 1 extra raging blow here and there and they’re good. They’re basically already casting a better Rampage three time in a row already and that’s before considering the strength difference. The best we can pray for is that our Recklessness and Avatar Uptime put us remotely close to the damage, but I haven’t run the numbers, so what do I know!","Aug 18, 2022 7:56 am",Warrior
"Maybe you thought you could get some of that JUICY 60% slaughtering strike action from Onslaught’s bonus talent, Tenderize? Guess again, because when you pick up annihilator, the Tenderize goes from 60% Bonus rampage damage to 6%, and since you always have at least 4 stacks out of 5 of annihilator from how fast daggers swing, tenderize becomes only a 2% increase on your next rampage’s damage. This has to be an oversight by their dev team, I cannot believe they would think that nerfing this talent from 60% bonus damage on your next rampage to at best 6% was for balancing reasons. It’s so, so bad in it’s current state it’s not worth considering.","Oct 26, 2022 2:43 pm",Warrior
"I don’t know if Blizzard has changed anything in 18 years of WoW regarding PPM, but how it used to be is that your yellow attacks had the same PPM on things that can proc as your white attacks. Meaning if you were using faster weapons and doing the same number of yellow attacks, your proc rates GO DOWN. Using Daggers, we’re going to have much lower proc chances on our yellow attacks and that sucks for anything that doesn’t have an internal cooldown and high proc chance. Compared to typical Single Minded Fury, we might barely beat them in procs due to more rampage use, but compared to Titan’s grip with it’s slow weapon speeds and Raging blow that hits twice, we should get less procs than Titan’s grip players and that feels dumb, felt dumb in vanilla, and it probably still works that way. Please, please, please link me to some patch notes where this was changed sometimes since WotLK (the last time I played WoW seriously). I would love to hear that yellow attack PPM no longer considers weapon speed and treats all weapons as the same speed for yellow attacks. Apparently Blizzard switched to RPPM in MoP and this is no longer an issue. I looked into how it’s tracked and it makes sense! Yay!","Oct 26, 2022 7:20 pm",Warrior
"Yep, they could just switch it to how it was, especially if somehow this spec ends up being too good. If Blizzard does nerf daggers/remove this, I’m going to claim that I won Dragonflight ^.^","Oct 27, 2022 12:53 am",Warrior
"Blizzard has been shaking some things up a bit and letting things be more free. They’ve brought back the customizability of talent trees, which is only reason I bought dragonflight.

"Fury struggles while levelling and when undergeared with secondary stats too low. For me personally, 25% haste is the minimum fir that stat.

"Arms Warrior has been the kingpin throughout Shadowland for large majority of it.

You can get all these things simultaneously but it’s got really only one thing going for which is skull splitter burst damage build based off bleeds, rends etc. However, this doesn’t work with the current meta and changes. With the 40% stamina buff. It’s really struggling, any spec that’s only focused on burst damage is going to have a hard time executing on kill windows given that avenue. It’s damage is in an all right position but honestly even with the mobility changes and survivability from impending victory, it’s survivability is the lowest of any specialization right now.","Nov 12, 2022 11:35 pm",Warrior
