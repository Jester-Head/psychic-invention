"I think that Shadow Priest is the most un fun, clunky, weird spec in the game right now.","Nov 19, 2022 2:06 pm",Priest
It feels terrible to play and doesn’t make sense with the spells it has for its rotation. It’s so weird.,"Nov 19, 2022 2:07 pm",Priest
That is weird because I find it very fun. Hm…,"Nov 19, 2022 2:10 pm",Priest
What about it do you find fun?,"Nov 19, 2022 2:30 pm",Priest
"The entire Insanity and “builder/spender” system feels super bad. It didn’t used to feel this way, but the changes make it obnoxious and annoying to play.","Nov 19, 2022 2:32 pm",Priest
"I actually think it’s one of the most fun classes to play atm, the synergies with mind blast/dots applying to all targets and being able to rot the whole team while targeting one person. The passive healing through damage making me feel durable, but the durability coming from doing damage. The old feeling of coming into combat with shield/renew just like 15 years ago. Mindgames (one of the most fun buttons in the game) even if it’s hard to get it to stick. The aesthetic, the shadowy apparitions coming out like crazy during a go and watching them flood the arena.","Nov 19, 2022 2:38 pm",Priest

Functionally it just feels really bad to play. Especially Shadow Crash and Void Spike… idk it just doesn’t feel “right” to me.,"Nov 19, 2022 2:45 pm",Priest

"I really enjoy how shadows playing right now. I like the depth of the priority list and all the gears turning to optimize your rotation at any given moment. Sometimes a spec just doesn’t mesh well some people. For me, I dislike unholy dk and demo lock even though those are two specs people often praise for feeling good. Maybe shadow just isn’t a playstyle you enjoy like I don’t enjoy other specs.","Nov 19, 2022 3:23 pm",Priest

"That’s about it really. Dungeons is passable but still got some clunk to it, and raids / single target it’s horrendous.","Nov 19, 2022 5:44 pm",Priest
Disagree. The rotation is awesome and the complexity makes it better.,"Nov 19, 2022 6:39 pm",Priest
SPriest is one of the clunkiest classes I’ve played. Synergy is there with a few abilities but most don’t seem to click well. Mastery is almost useless and caps are dreadful with no control.,"Nov 19, 2022 6:46 pm",Priest
"On Max’s stream currently he is talking to people and putting together tier ranks on a nice chart. And yeah, tier ranks are subject to change because of incoming nerfs and buffs. Yada yada yada. That said we probably all want to decide on what we are going to play.","Nov 15, 2022 6:17 pm",Priest

Any thoughts?,"Nov 15, 2022 8:45 pm",Priest
Must be for raid considering Evoker’s in A. I can’t imagine Evoker being anything but S in M+. But everything else is pretty much how I feel right now.,"Nov 15, 2022 11:19 pm",Priest
"Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking.","Nov 15, 2022 11:32 pm",Priest

"Just came back, did they really turn sear into a spender? This was a tremendously bad idea.
WE have no real AoE at all other than 15-30 second cooldown skills and single target rotations?
Shadow AoE feels so clunky and bad right now.
Am i missing something here please tell me i am.","Nov 12, 2022 10:13 pm",Priest
It is kinda messy right now. I’d like to see MS put back as a builder too and make Shadow Crash a spender. I like having instant cast abilities as spenders and hurling out SC more often would be fun.,"Nov 12, 2022 10:18 pm",Priest
"That would make FAR more sense… as it stands its really clunky IMO, especially compared to other specs with much more fluid AoE.","Nov 12, 2022 10:33 pm",Priest
"Shadow AoE is mostly about spirits now. You generate them with Blast, but our spender generates them too in Mind Sear - Shadow Crash now applies VT up to 8 targets, and Mind Sear extends DoTs - VT also grants psychic link, which blast/spike work with.","Nov 12, 2022 11:09 pm",Priest

"agree, I liked the aoe rotation and it did not feel clunky tbh, if anything ST felt weird but it might be due to the fact I was using aoe spec.","Nov 13, 2022 3:32 pm",Priest
"i disagree that shadow needs an aoe builder . hard disagree in fact.
so many specs rn have ST builders/ST spenders + aoe builder/aoe spender.
if you played shadow at lvl 70 beta rn you would know it’s not clunky if you’re decent at multi-dotting and its quite competitive.
and if you don’t quite enjoy multidotting/dot maintenance maybe shadow isn’t the spec for you? maybe mage ?","Nov 13, 2022 3:36 pm",Priest

"From a M+ perspective in DF-PP, us SPs have ~70% haste or ~50% crit depending on your Shrouded buff. So I’m still a bit sus on this spec. I’m still going to play it in DF. I haven’t played any DF-Beta, just came at DF-PP.","Nov 17, 2022 9:48 pm",Priest
"First thing I want to address is the change to mind sear costing an absurd amount of insanity… it feels terrible. Change this back to generating insanity.
Second thing I want to talk about is the idea of insanity in general. I don’t believe every single class and spec needs this spender/builder design… BUT if they wanted to go that route I think going back to system like shadow orbs was much better. My suggestion is making mind spike the “spender” of the orbs or insanity.
One idea I had is make mind spike do different things based on how many of your dots are on the target. For example, zero dots = applies all dots /// one dot = 100% crit chance // two dots = puts up a debuff for 100% haste on dot ticks for like 10 seconds /// three dots = 300% mind spike damage (or something, open to ideas for 3 dots)
Also you can make talents make mind spike hit multiple targets that way you could have a spender for aoe situations too… could be a fun and interesting design. Either way the mind sear costing and not generating is just not the move guys. Lets talk about it.","Nov 17, 2022 10:34 pm",Priest
"I wish we had no spenders, to begin with.
Not every class in the game needs to be designed with a boring spender in mind.","Nov 18, 2022 3:32 am",Priest
"Aion classes are build upon chain skill activation. Skills that can only be activated by using a previous skill sequence. The more chain skills a spell/ ability has, the less frequent the higher tier chain procs. But the higher tier chains end up having high impact due to low procs.","Nov 18, 2022 10:37 am",Priest

"Also. This game is designed with everyone having everything. There is no real dot class because almost every class has at least 1-2 dots that end up doing most of your dmg, its dumb. Only AFF i would say gains that title but only when overly buffed (like currently).","Nov 19, 2022 7:41 am",Priest

Thoughts?,"Nov 19, 2022 8:16 am",Priest
"I’ll have to see, it was relatively okay at 55% in the old style talent trees, i can see it being worth taking 2 talent points into for AoE after launch with our Mind sear target cap being so damn low","Nov 19, 2022 9:02 am",Priest
"Certainly a huge buff to the talent since people were only taking mind sear because there was no better option for AoE…i was already using psychic link before switching to Mind sear and i really liked it, but now its more damage and can become a contender. we will need to see what comes out of this though…","Nov 19, 2022 9:41 am",Priest

"Disc on the other hand, damage output is insane, healing throughput is enough to keep people up, BUT wholly do you ever go oom wildly fast. The mana efficiency or basically lake thereof seems to make disc almost completely unviable in arenas.","Nov 18, 2022 11:34 pm",Priest

"It feels good when you can generate Insanity fast enough to use it or get several Mind Devourer procs. I think it’s nice to finally have an AoE Insanity spender. It was pretty dull having Devouring Plague as the only spender. What they should do is get rid of Mind Spike and replace it with an AoE filler. We don’t need two single target fillers. Also, Insanity generation needs a boost.","Nov 13, 2022 1:30 am",Priest
"I find myself holding back my Mind sears until i get procs from Mind devourer or until i get to like 75+ insanity, but after some messing around with talents, mind sear is still a nicer option…i still find myself wanting to take psychic link most times, but i need to leave it alone","Nov 17, 2022 12:55 pm",Priest
"Mind Sear is now a proper spender which actually does damage now, rather than just tickling the pack. Insanity cost needs to be lowered, but it’s a step in the right direction in terms of the damage the spell actually does now.","Nov 17, 2022 1:00 pm",Priest

You devs clearly don’t have a solid direction for this spec and you have no one but Ion to blame.

"they would either be too strong or too bad, full shield healer playstyle is toxic to the game in a raid scenario specially when that former iteration you want only allows for ONE disc priest per raid making it hard for people to find a raid group if the disc priest you NEED because running one would become mandatory for every single serious raid group.","Nov 8, 2022 10:32 am",Priest
"On top of that it diminishes the enjoyment of every other healer in the group because it’s not like former disc was “on a cooldown”, it was “ON” all the time and they would continue to shield people for over half the tank’s HP, they were a tank/raid healer that couldn’t overheal.","Nov 8, 2022 11:08 am",Priest

It’s not the strongest/main playstyle, but it hasn’t been for half a decade. Dps to Heal relationship is fundamentally good for the game as a healer, both mechanically and entertainment value.

"I am generally pretty happy with it, but only really looked at the Holy tree. My main feedback is that Shackle Undead is just NOT good enough to be a talent. I think it should be baseline. I don’t think it needs to apply to more creature types, but it’s not strong enough to be considered more than a flavour ability in most cases.","Jul 1, 2022 2:17 pm",Priest

"And then the fact that we have Mindgames on our Class talent tree, and then we also have Light’s Wrath back on our Discipline talent tree? Our burst looks like it can be INSANE.","Jul 1, 2022 2:34 pm",Priest
"I am confused about one thing though, which is on our Class talent tree. It looks like Mind Control is becoming a talent, which I guess makes sense because other classes are getting their CC put on the talent tree too, but the tooltip of Mind Control confuses me. It reads, “Controls a mind up to 1 level above yours for 30 sec while still controlling your own mind. Does not work versus Demonic, Mechanical, or Undead beings or players.”","Jul 1, 2022 2:45 pm",Priest
"…The tooltip sounds like its the Dominant Mind talent we currently have (specifically because it says while STILL controlling your own mind) but then right below the Mind Control talent, is Dominant Mind which is the same talent we currently have. A few things worry me because, while it could be a bugged tooltip, the part, “Does not work against players” makes me worry that I wont be able to cast my normal Mind Control on players. Hopefully its tooltip error though.","Jul 1, 2022 2:48 pm",Priest

Love the shadow spell synergy focus in the disc tree, lots of interesting implications there. Havent looked at holy. Base priest tree im still formulating my thoughts, though i think Power Infusion + double pi is going to be the subject of criticism on the high end.

While the insanity cost is quite steep i kinda like the idea because they actually made it do good damage for once in its entire existence.,"Nov 15, 2022 5:02 pm",Priest
"I’ve had full insanity and not had Mind Sear available. However, I’ve had it available a number of times. But the reality is that even when it is available the insanity cost is really high. Often times when I do get to use it it does not finish because I run out of insanity. Yes, the damage output seems higher, if I remember the old version correctly, but it still seems unlikely I get to use it for its full duration. Plus if you happen to have it on a target that is lower in health than others nearby you could end up triggering it, which costs 50 to start, and then the target could die before really get into it and you’re 25 insanity down for that first hit. Obviously a little better planning on which target is in order but the cost seems too high.","Nov 18, 2022 12:14 am",Priest
"The cost is exactly the same as devouring plague per GCD, which is the goal because otherwise it would mean in AoE you spend resources at a slower rate than you do in single target.","Nov 18, 2022 12:58 am",Priest
"Personally I think the fact the spell has a channel that abruptly ends is the thing that makes it feel bad, there’s zero benefit at all to actually finishing a mind sear channel, the full duration means nothing and you’re not “wasting” the cast by not getting to the end of it.","Nov 18, 2022 1:33 am",Priest

Ticks of dmg from each. It has an incredibly low proc rate however.,"Nov 12, 2022 3:56 pm",Priest
When it does decide to procc like 2 or 3 times in a short time it looks amazing and I find it visually overloads people in pvp and confuses them.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:05 pm",Priest
Agree.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:18 pm",Priest
I wish it wouldn’t be so random. I’ve had multiple up at times and other times dry spells so long I had to order a crate of carmex for my lips on Amazon.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:22 pm",Priest
I would prefer if there was more predictability with them like on successful completion of a channeled spell you proc 1. This would give some more ebb and flow especially in PvP deciding if you can get away with a full channel or not. A little reward for not being kicked.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:25 pm",Priest
Obviously some changes to damage and total amount uptime to compensate for the guaranteed tentacle but I would much rather see more consistency with them. Right now they are too random and outshined by other nodes.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:33 pm",Priest
"3/4 of our Capstones are really bad atm because you have zero control over when they decide to procc. In almost every single case I would rather take that single point and place it into something that guarantees a boost in DPS over a “random, maybe, could be, sort of” talent.","Nov 12, 2022 6:58 pm",Priest
The one capstone you have control over forces you to summon a purple squid jellyfish thing every min to even use effectively which just feels weird doing as a Shadow Priest.,"Nov 12, 2022 8:21 pm",Priest

"I think the mind flay pvp talent should have been put into the spec tree. Haste for finishing a mind flay cast would be nice. Talents like Idol of C’thun make me dislike the RPPM system blizzard has. If you get a few good procs you are guaranteed famine for a little while. I get that it works in reverse as well but sometimes I just want RNG to be RNG, the highs and lows that come with it. I’d rather they have implemented an actual luck stat to help RNG based builds.","Nov 15, 2022 3:06 pm",Priest
"The C’Thun capstone really should just spawn a single target tentacle when you cast Devouring Plague and an aoe tentacle when you cast Mind Sear after spending 100 Insanity, or just spawn with every use but have a max of 5 or something.","Nov 15, 2022 3:56 pm",Priest
"This is by far my favorite capstone talent. It is so satisfying seeing multiple tentacles spamming Mind Flay and Mind Sear. The Insanity generation feels great when you have several up at the same time. However, it feels awful when nothing spawns for long periods of time. Given how long it takes to generate 100 Insanity to use Mind Sear, the tentacle that has a chance to spawn that spams Mind Sear should do a lot more damage.","Nov 17, 2022 3:56 pm",Priest
Ok this is better than my idea. New tentacle on DP sounds nice.,"Nov 17, 2022 4:21 pm",Priest
"I would really like to see a talent that rewards channeling Mind Flay to completion or near completion. I think talents that buff weak abilities or fillers interesting. Mind Flay: Insanity is a good example. Similar to Prayermonger’s idea, it may be interesting if Idol of C’Thun was changed so that channeling Mind Flay to completion or near completion spawns a Void Tendril. That would be like indirectly increasing the damage and Insanity generation of Mind Flay. Make Mind Sear an AoE filler again (create a new AoE Insanity spender) and spawn a Void Lasher upon channeling to completion or near completion. The tentacle duration would prevent the player from spawning an unlimited amount.","Nov 17, 2022 8:29 pm",Priest

"Generally, you shouldn’t cast renew unless you need atonement on a single target, PW:S is on cooldown and you have to move.","Nov 15, 2022 3:41 pm",Priest
"Use Radiance if you need coverage on everyone. Otherwise, it’s best to put it up with PW:S (especially on the tank) or flash heal (especially with binding heals talented, as it will apply atonement on you as well).","Nov 15, 2022 3:57 pm",Priest
"A lot of your healing will come from PW:S now - often coming equal to or better than atonement. You should be making an effort to put it on your tank if nobody else is taking damage. You don’t have to perfectly cast it off CD, but you’ll definitely notice how much it’s preventing the more you use it.","Nov 15, 2022 4:30 pm",Priest
"As far as what damage to use, it depends on your talents a little bit. Specifically, it matters if you took Twilight Empowerment. In that case you should be trying to use that on things that cleave/spread as much as possible. Getting a twilight empowered purge the wicked cast will ALSO empower the spread dots when you use penance. Generally, I find that prioritizing empowerment on Halo/Divine Star, followed by Purge The Wicked and lastly Penance are the important ones. As far as why no shadow spells are listed, those should be empowered by default, since you can always Smite or Purge the Wicked before casting a shadow spell - wheras we have limited shadow spells so have to choose what to empower from our holy list. So a basic idea is something like: Schism → Divine Star/Halo → Mind Blast → Purge the Wicked → Penance (unempowered, but spreads your empowered purge). Etc. On single target, obviously you don’t need to empower your cleave as much.","Nov 15, 2022 4:37 pm",Priest
"If you aren’t using Twilight Empowerment, order of spells doesn’t matter. General rule there is get a PW:S up and cast purge the wicked on as many mobs as you can while tank is pulling (keeping in mind you can spread PTW with penance, so generally leave 2 targets without dots). When the tank stops, use penance to spread a purge the wicked to anything you couldn’t cast it on.","Nov 15, 2022 4:48 pm",Priest
"After that, Divine Star/Halo is your top priority for mob groups. Otherwise, use spells at your own discretion. Once you put Schism up, you should be focusing that target with penance/Mind Blast/Mindgames (if you took it). If there’s not a lot of damage happening and it’s an AoE pull, you’re clear to Holy Nova. Generally you want to continue shielding your tank (or whoever might take damage) while you’re doing this.","Nov 15, 2022 4:50 pm",Priest
"For anything that is a big damage event that you know is coming (like a boss AoE, or a mob pack that drops some bad AoE) Rapture is your answer. Keep in mind, when you first hit rapture it automatically puts a PW:S on your target when you initially cast it.","Nov 15, 2022 4:54 pm",Priest
"My biggest tip that i learnt the hard way in legion and it seems people still need to learn it, Dont expect to be able to use atonement healing to get everyone up all the time. Its an intricate dance between dpsing and healing and there are times to stop dpsing to heal. Too often i let tanks die in legion because i was too busy dpsing","Nov 15, 2022 4:58 pm",Priest
"Playing disc well is an art. As for healing dungeons, you have to be able to gauge when to apply atonement, when to heal via Flash Heal and when to simply dps. Disc can be mana intensive though, so you want be conservative but not so conservative that your party members drop dead. And you want to learn to look for safe spots so you can do your thing without interruption for at least a cast or two, maybe more. You also want to use things like Pain Suppression, your dome, and Rapture to get you through harder pulls. I say that because it is easy to forget to take full advantage of your kit.","Nov 15, 2022 5:34 pm",Priest

"On my shadow priest, I have the misery talent and it was working great until yesterdays update (11/15//2022). Now, when I cast vampiric touch it does not always apply shadow word pain like it did previously to yesterdays patch. Sometimes it applies only vampiric touch and sometimes it only applies shadow word pain. Sometimes it applies both like it is supposed to. Also when I try to recast vampiric touch to reapply both DoTs, it will only add the missing DoT on a different timer. (Example, vampiric touch only gets added, then i recast and it adds shadow word pain but does not refresh the timer on vampiric touch). Another issue is that Devouring plague does not always get applied to the target but it always spends the insanity, whether it applies to the target or not. Again, I have never had this issue until yesterday. It effects shadow crash as well. Usually shadow crash will add vampiric touch and shadow word pain to all targets in the aoe; now it adds both to some targets, then maybe vampiric touch to a target, then maybe just shadow word pain to another target. Sometimes it works as intended and adds both DoTs to all targets in the aoe. Is this a bug or working as intended? Does it have to do with me being a lower level and spells missing the target? I am now level 58, but I was running the dungeon with General Kaal in it, cant remember the name and lots of the dots i was casting were just not being applied to several targets. Please help!

"Not sure about the healing specs, but shadow feels kinda chaotic. Cool downs are on odd intervals, feels more like I am managing a character instead of having fun playing it. Dots are the main source of dmg still, and mind spike and mind blast are still low dmg fillers. They need to up the insanity generation, or make mind spike and mind blast do 20% base dmg.

"The playstyle is going to change…we are going to be seeing a similar playstyle that we had in mists where Mind Flay: insanity is your filler with no procs, then using Mind Spike and mind blast procs when needed. only problem is we don’t have Mind Sear as an AoE option anymore unless they change it back to a filler.

"Mind Sear feels bad now…by the time we get full insanity to spend on Mind sear, mobs are already dead or its not worth casting the spell, and we also don’t get enough out of the cast to justify pooling our insanity to 100% just for like 1 tic of mind sear.

I don’t think it feels super bad but it could be better. Few suggesting to make the class play better (and don’t think it would break the class).,"Nov 12, 2022 12:00 am",Priest
I agree. Dots usually last full duration between Shadow Crash with free Mind Sear procs. You can get unlucky though and have no procs which sucks. I was actually questioning whether the proc is bugged last night while working on a training dummy. I would go a long time with no procs. 20% should be high enough to reliably get free Mind Sears but it doesn’t seem to be the case. Seems I was casting over 10 MB with no procs quite often. I am going to look into this further.,"Nov 12, 2022 2:09 am",Priest
honestly even if they just made shadow crash hasted and reverted the VT insanity talent to 50/100% i think we’d be in a way better spot for M+,"Nov 12, 2022 5:58 am",Priest
"if they wanted to take it a step further, i’d like an extra 10-20 insanity cap or to lower the actual cost of a full channel of mind sear, so we aren’t overcapping to get a full duration, being forced to waste a resource sucks","Nov 12, 2022 7:45 am",Priest

*open with Shadow crash, into power infusion then cast dark ascension into shadow fiend (assuming you have the Shadowfiend/mindbender leggo effect) , use your DP on a target and start casting Mind flay: insanity, then use mind blast or Mind spike to benefit from them doing splash damage, continue to dot DP on targets into Mind Flay: insanity for more damage, then continue…i was doing pretty good damage on almost every pull.
