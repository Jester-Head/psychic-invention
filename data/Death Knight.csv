Might of the Frozen Wastes has to be baseline! what is worth a talent point and helps further equality between 2H n DW is replacing it with our current 4piece bonus but only if wielding a 2H weapon this would help tremendously with razor ice stacks.,"Oct 17, 2022 10:13 am",Death Knight
or another option is to replace motfw with: if wielding a 2H weapon Killing machine procs store 2 charges. if that seems too OP Murderous efficiency can be 2 points 25/50% to get where motf is. this would help with our low crit chance proc rate of KM compared to DW,"Oct 20, 2022 2:02 pm",Death Knight
"to be honest they could probably swap Shattering blade and glacial advance and scrap the current glacial advance n make the current 4piece set bonus that node for both dw n 2H or
keep them both how they are and make shattering blade cause a glacial advance at least that would make frost strike be more interactive","Oct 20, 2022 2:35 pm",Death Knight
Been asking for them to make MotFW a passive again all alpha/beta. It should not have been put in the new talent tree in the first place.,"Oct 20, 2022 7:53 pm",Death Knight
"Not sure why the DK dev, who has made other improvements, is sleeping on this.
As it stands, you can’t even play a proper 2H Oblit spec in prepatch due to insufficient talent points for MotFW.","Oct 20, 2022 8:58 pm",Death Knight
"What I would like is for them to equalize this crumby back and fourth weapon imbalance within the spec, right now 2h is infront of DW and before that the roles were flipped, I agree that it should be made baseline just as I think DW should deal equal dmg and vice versa.","Oct 20, 2022 11:41 pm",Death Knight

"yeah what i would have liked to see with our character progression and power is see an evolution of our baseline abilities, imagin having to lvl to max just to play the spec u played for the last 4 yrs.
I love the talent tree idea and freedom, but talents should be for choosing between 2 talents like “frostrike cost 5rp more but cleaves” or “frostrike cost 5rp more but adds a stack of razor ice”
obviously more exciting things but just that choice of making our characters power evolve and become stronger","Oct 21, 2022 8:22 am",Death Knight

I would like to see both 2-Hand combat and Duel-Wield combat style return for all 3 Death Knight specs.,"Jun 4, 2022 4:33 pm",Death Knight
It could be simply given baseline or it might also be good as a talent.,"Jun 4, 2022 5:33 pm",Death Knight
"Edit: As a poster mentioned below, perhaps it is a better idea to make 2-Hand the default and Duel-Wield something you can talent into? I like this idea and Im sure could be tuned and introduced in such a way as to benifit not just Frost but Blood and Unholy as well.","Jun 4, 2022 8:06 pm",Death Knight
"My original idea, was to implement a talent with an “either/or” 1 pointer, where you would chose if to go into 2-hand or duel-wield, however after thinking a bit more and reading some feedback here, that could be harder/more convoluted to balance and would likely br needlessly complicated.","Jun 5, 2022 2:15 am",Death Knight

"2 Handed should be default for all 3 specs and dual wield should be a talent, giving you the benefit of an extra runeforge.","Jun 5, 2022 9:11 am",Death Knight
And what would this talent do exactly? Is it going to give Blood and Unholy the Threat of Thassarian passive that frost has which is basically hidden at this point? Why would anyone use a 2h instead of DW? Same damage output + 2 runeforges are better than 1 runeforge. Are they going to have to make an incentive to pick a 2h then and having a motfw talent somewhere in these trees to give some value back to 2h weapons?,"Jun 5, 2022 5:47 pm",Death Knight
Unholy and Blood werent designed for the use of DW. It would be a trap talent if it was just “here you can DW now as blood or unholy”. Yeah you might get 2 runeforges but you are missing a lot of damage since your offhand would be doing nothing if not addressed.,"Jun 5, 2022 6:43 pm",Death Knight
It would run into the same problems with 2h for frost. Frost was designed for DW and you have issues that need to be worked on for that and it would just be the opposite for Unholy and Blood both being designed with a 2h.,"Jun 5, 2022 7:27 pm",Death Knight

I wouldn’t care how it implemented as long as it felt good.,"Jul 6, 2022 1:21 pm",Death Knight
"I dont mind people having access to DW if they like it, but there needs to be a proper balance between 2h and dw. If dw/2h were just baseline and dw by default only hit with MH when using abilities then they have a talent that allows 2h to use a second runeforge, but also allowed dw to hit with the OH when using abilities.","Jul 6, 2022 4:31 pm",Death Knight
"currently having frost 2h hidden behind a talent means that 2h frost loses a talent point with no gain in output. The 30% obliterate damage and increased KM chance is to compensate the lack of 2 runeforges and not a dps bonus, so there is really no gain for spending a talent point when you take it.","Jul 6, 2022 6:11 pm",Death Knight
"also a lot of frost is based on number of attacks, like icecap and KM procs, which gives dw an advantage. I think if they changed this to proccing off certain abilities that are uniform (like froststrike or FF ticks) for both 2h and dw it would help.","Jul 6, 2022 6:29 pm",Death Knight
"What would be done with DW blood and unholy? There would be no reason to take it unless you want to tank your DPS. You would be losing damage, and not really gaining anything. A second runeforge while strong, isnt just going to magically make DW good on these specs.","Jul 6, 2022 6:55 pm",Death Knight
"Its the same thing with 2h for frost. When they just implemented 2h in the beta without MotFW it was absolute garbage. It wasnt worth it what so ever. Less KM procs, the damage was lower because no 2 runeforges doesnt work well with some talents and there are more going into DF like Cold-Blooded Rage.","Jul 6, 2022 6:55 pm",Death Knight

"And yes, there is a lore reason as to why DK’s have blue eyes, not red, not purple, not yellow, but blue. Its because of the magics used to create them. Lady Alistra is most likely a banshee in the flesh which are really good at unholy magics because thats how they get their body back. Death Knights dont go through that process. I dont think the night warrior eyes were intended for death knights either but once they were able to use them because of whatever reason, they had to keep the option in. Lore wise, death knights shouldnt be able to have the night warrior eyes, and in fact it shows that eye color is based on magics and certain processes, just like Dk eye color and Blood Elf eye color, Night Elf eye color, Nightborne eye color, Void Elf eye color.","Jun 1, 2022 8:43 am",Death Knight

This is coupled with there being numerous talents that are dead for one spec vs others, for example control undead is a really really hard sell for unholy. I’m looking forward to experimenting with it and it does seem like it’ll enable some interesting playstyles and choices, in particular it seems like you can make unholy and frost surprisingly tanky, and blood gets a lot of damage options.

am I missing something?,"Nov 12, 2022 7:24 pm",Death Knight

"Not only does it better fit the “fantasy” of a Frost Death Knight (a slow-moving, hulking behemoth of a man), but I think by tying its identity directly to Arthas (much as Havoc DH’s are to Illidan), it would inspire more players to take up the mantle of Tanking, which is always helpful in MMO’s.","Jun 16, 2022 12:53 pm",Death Knight
"In a more startling shift, I would change Unholy to be more of a traditional “Necromancer”. Not totally traditional, mind you; just more so.

"That was a really cool fantasy anyways, and this could bridge the gap a little more with the WC2-era Death Knight, who was also quite cool in his own right.

"While Frost and Undead serve as solid callbacks to Arthas and the WC2 era Death Knight, respectively, I would use the opportunity to reinvent Blood spec a bit.","Jul 5, 2022 3:34 pm",Death Knight
"It would be the more pure Melee DPS-spec. I would throw a spin on things by perhaps coupling their ability to drain blood (health) with abilities to also expend it. I would go entirely Dracula/Vlad the Impaler for inspiration for the spec, depicting Blood DK’s as mighty, bloodthirsty warriors, but also with a dark, supernatural/vampiric quality.","Jul 5, 2022 6:26 pm",Death Knight
"To give the spec a bit more defined “personality”, I’d say you’d want Blood spec represented by either some kind of bloodthirsty Orc (perhaps re-defining Nazgrim as a Blood DK?), or maybe a Blood Elf or one of the San’layn.","Sep 27, 2022 6:14 pm",Death Knight
"I think these specs would feel far more distinctive and iconic that the current ones we have. Sure, the current specs “work”, but honestly I don’t think any one spec is particularly exciting. They just don’t seem to convey a sense of identity anymore.","Sep 27, 2022 9:44 pm",Death Knight
"Speaking of which, now that we have so many dual-wielding classes in the game, I would legitimately propose removing dual-wielding entirely. I simply don’t think it fits the Death Knight class. As for the Legion artifact, just retcon it to a singular “Blade of the Fallen Prince”, and increase the size of the 1hander models to be suitable for 2handers.","Sep 28, 2022 11:28 am",Death Knight
"I was thinking Unholy mainly needs a change, cause its been boring for a long time, and thought if it was more like the new Demonology it’d be more fun. Like make it have 3 pets, the Ghoul for lower DPS but moves fast, the bulkier thing that you turned the ghoul into for high DPS, and the big guy from the PvP talents as a tank pet, but without the aoe cloud that’d be a PvP talent choice, and the revamp of Unholy be more ranged based, cause I think a ranged plate wearer be pretty cool.","Sep 29, 2022 7:27 pm",Death Knight
"I don’t know a lot of these by name cause I haven’t MAINED DK for a LONG time cause of how Blizzard just keeps them under powered for last 3 expansions. I mean it is not fair that WW Monk is still SO POWERFUL after all these years, I think Blizzard just hates DK’s.","Sep 29, 2022 8:40 pm",Death Knight

"I’ve been a little salty at Blizzard since the Frost tank change. What made me fall in love with the DK at Wrath release was Frost tanking. Dark Knights in general have been a favorite of mine across most lore. The whole Frost tank thing just fit so well in my mind, I loved it. When they changed it, I didn’t play my DK again for a long time lol. It still stings.","Oct 2, 2022 8:08 am",Death Knight
"I just think, in terms of “themes” and “fantasy” of each Spec, these changes honestly make a lot more sense.","Oct 4, 2022 7:51 pm",Death Knight
"Like… there’s absolutely NOTHING about a “Frost” spec that would imply “big melee damage”. Blood, by contrast, seems a lot more fitting, conjuring to mind images of a warrior fueled by blood rituals, siphoning blood from his enemies. A lot of people STILL mentally equate Blood with the DPS it used to represent, being quite cleave-heavy.","Oct 4, 2022 10:02 pm",Death Knight
"With Unholy, I think it’s clear players still love the idea of a “Necromancer”, and Unholy really fits that niche incredibly well. As a Death Knight, I imagine you would still maintain a certain amount of presence in melee range, but as mentioned, maybe you spend MOST of your time at a range, building up resource for your “big hits” for melee range?","Oct 4, 2022 10:59 pm",Death Knight
"I just came back to retail for DF, and I’m playing Blood DK. For some reason, if I’m in combat, my DnD will automaticaly place itself once I activate it. I don’t like this. I prefer the old style where I activate and then place the ability. Is there a way to disable this function? I don’t have any kind of mouseover options enabled.","Nov 14, 2022 11:17 am",Death Knight

"Frost and unholy feel like the most boring classes in the game at the moment. While some classes feel much better, like shadow priest and enhancement, I feel like DK has been dumbed down to something even beneath diablo immortal.","Oct 29, 2022 8:21 pm",Death Knight
Why are there no diseases to manage anymore? How about actually making rune power expenditure require decision making?,"Oct 29, 2022 8:26 pm",Death Knight

"Do dps dks work like the two examples you gave? No, and thats a good thing. Both Unholy and frost have a tone of micro management (see above) plus about 5 or 6 cds, honestly it seems like you havent played either spec.","Oct 31, 2022 2:23 am",Death Knight

"Then you haven’t really played enough variants of Frost; they are quite honestly the same. The only real difference is 2022 is actually better designed since things are finally flowing well together, with actual cohesion in the design. Personally, I’m not enjoying it, but I recognize that it is better than past iterations without a doubt.","Nov 4, 2022 2:05 am",Death Knight
"People love to hate it but it’s actually a very well designed spec, especially amongst the melee options. If there weren’t 10 points / 5 talents in the center that were just “do X% more damage”, I think it could have a lot better reception.","Nov 4, 2022 2:10 am",Death Knight

"I figured it out–the talent “Raise Dead” replaces “Raise Dead” with the permanent pet. I was confused because, even without that talent, you get the pet automatically when you spec into Unholy.
