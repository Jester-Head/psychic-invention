"I don’t mind the changes honestly, i mean, affy has been busted since pre-patch to be fair. that’s no secret. At this time tho, as of about 20 mins ago, me and my arena partner (we both geared up our locks to 300 since they were busted kek) are convinced there is a bug with drain life now. We noticed throughout today that it felt like we weren’t getting a lot back from drain life. Then the last arena match we played confirmed something was going on. Even with desperate pact talent (DL heals for 30% more when under 50% health) drain life is basically healing for nothing even under 50%. (condensed) Assassination rogue did his garrote kidney opener on me, i popped unending resolve to get the full fear on him. while he’s feared, i soul rot and drain life and my health does not move up AT ALL. Soul rot did apply to the spriest on his team.","Nov 11, 2022 7:09 pm",Warlock

"In the Wrath pre patch they removed the Warlock Felhunter quest Seeking Strahad from the game and made it so you can learn the Felhunter from your class trainer at 30. My Warlock was level 45 when this happened and he was using a succubus as affliction during the end of TBC. From the pre patch to today I have been unable to acquire this pet. It is not offered at the trainer, the origonal questline does not exist anymore, and I still do not have the pet in my spellbook or in my trainers learned or unlearned spells. It is not in the game for me.","Nov 14, 2022 1:13 pm",Warlock

"This settles down at 70 by a fair margin, but it’s balanced. I think at 70 all the specs are viable. But time will tell.","Nov 13, 2022 3:25 pm",Warlock
It’s pre patch and you’re probably looking at raid numbers right? A lot of clases get good numbers from motes. Aff just does a bit better due to Soul Flame. Balance Druid is doing amazing as well.,"Nov 13, 2022 3:32 pm",Warlock
"But as others have stated, pre patch means absolutely nothing. It means nothing who is on top or bottom right now, within three weeks we’ll be at 70.","Nov 13, 2022 4:02 pm",Warlock

"Similar to last season demo basically having the job of dumping all your imps every tyrant cycle into motes due to the uncapped aoe, it did absurd aoe damage, but the true benefit was it bugged everybody else in the raid extensively.","Nov 14, 2022 3:11 pm",Warlock

I’m still deciding around which toons I want to main for DF. One of my Options is returning to my Warlock. What looks to be the most desired spec for Raiding/Mythic+. Are they all relatively equal?,"Nov 10, 2022 8:37 am",Warlock
I’ve only been playing Affliction but I’m usually top dps in keys and top 3 in raid (the few we’ve done since the new talents came out). Have seen some of the other locks in my guild going destruction. They’re doing really well in keys with high trash packs (like gambit) and their single target seems really good.,"Nov 10, 2022 8:42 am",Warlock
Was a demo lock for season 4 but none of us have tried it out yet. I’ve read the buffs to Implosion and Imp Gang Boss have made keys better after the dog nerf. I think it’s single target took a big hit with the new talents tho.,"Nov 10, 2022 10:24 am",Warlock
"Since I’ve tried it out, I’ll give some feedback: Demo’s hard to judge because you need to be 70 since it’s heavy reliant on tyrant damage and the other capstones whereas Destro and Aff have viable capstone legendary combinations. Demo still feels good in my opinion and has good potential, just needs the other capstones to reach the full single target damage (which I could be totally wrong in my thought process that it’s single target would become viable then). The downside of it is that it’s best single target damage build includes Nether Portal which, in my opinion, is the worse warlock spell out there. Theory and lore wise, amazing! Actual application feels awful since you have to complete change your normal rotation with it to get the best value out of it and even then, it’s damage is crap compared to other 3 minute cooldowns.","Nov 11, 2022 8:08 am",Warlock
"Destro and Aff feel great in general (in my opinion) though so if you are wanting to return to your warlock, you have options on how you want to play with either DOT damage or hurling big chaos bolts (there’s even a build that makes it so incinerate does good damage too which is a lot of fun, especially in keys)","Nov 11, 2022 8:57 am",Warlock
TLDR: Demo require 70 to fully get the feel on how the spec is going to perform while Aff and Derstro you can already kind of get a feel on which are both fun and enjoyable. So it depends on if you want to do DOT DPS or Big Chaos Bolts (or big incinerate) damage at the moment.,"Nov 11, 2022 12:52 pm",Warlock
"Wait thats the one that has a chance to summon a pit lord, tho? Sounds like fun.
Demo looks interesting and fun to play, I think I could get behind it. Will have to look at some vids of it on Beta. Definitely holding out hope its good.","Nov 11, 2022 8:04 pm",Warlock
"I was always a Fan of Destro, even went through the pains of leveling him fully as Destro back in TBC. I know its great at cleave and 2 targets fights usually, but how is it do with Aoe/trash packs in Mythics?","Nov 12, 2022 3:44 am",Warlock
"Affliction is the bane of my existence, I dont know why. I could just never get it to do decent numbers. Even once they removed snapshot and everyone said its the easiest spec of them all. I think if Aff was the goto spec for all content, my lock would stay shelved.","Nov 12, 2022 3:46 am",Warlock
"Yeah it sounds like fun, until you play it, then it’s just bleh.","Nov 12, 2022 4:16 am",Warlock
I’m still giving hope that reign of tyranny & nether portal will sync well together… really not trying to go gulliotine route.,"Nov 12, 2022 4:18 am",Warlock
"The big problem with Nether Portal is the rotation. Instead of using the usual casting of 3 Shadowbolts then Hand of Guldan, you cast Shadowbolt - Hand- Shadowbolt- Hand, etc.","Nov 12, 2022 4:22 am",Warlock
"Basically, its a messy rotation that’s counter-intuitive to how you normally play Demo.","Nov 12, 2022 4:30 am",Warlock
"Warlock won’t bring anything to M+ in terms of utility, the only reason someone might bring a warlock is for cheese (if any), and if the warlock offers high damage. But everything else is kind of whatever really. If you can bring classes with B-rez, Heroism/bloodlust, or anything else it would be significantly better.","Nov 12, 2022 4:48 am",Warlock
"Warlocks will generally be wanted for raid for health stones and sometimes gateways to get around certain mechanics. Plus Warlocks do consistent damage, and have burst windows. Some are better at aoe than ST though, which may be a trade off.","Nov 12, 2022 4:57 am",Warlock
"If damage is meager, they may just bring one lock to raid.","Nov 12, 2022 5:26 am",Warlock
"Seems kind of weird. But I guess if you go that ramp route it may not be worthwhile.
I usually go Grimoire Felguard, Doggos, Tyrant, then start pumping imps, then power siphon–> 2 demon bolts, then pump out more imps, if any free cast of doggos toss em out as they come back. By that point you can just build up. Idk If I’d open with 3 shadowbolts but to each their own.","Nov 12, 2022 5:42 am",Warlock

"Warlocks bring Brez, which is highly desired in M+. You simply don’t queue without it.","Nov 12, 2022 7:38 am",Warlock
