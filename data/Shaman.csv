They honestly look really good in PvE overall. Fast paced and fun with their usual utility. It may take some getting used to building talent loadouts for specific dungeons / content however since it’s difficult to get everything we currently have all of the time.,"Oct 25, 2022 9:54 pm",Shaman
"The class tree is a quite point starved for PvP however. Thunderstorm / Lightning Lasso, Ancestral Guidance, double shields, and things like Earth Shield / Feral Lunge / Wind Rush / Earthgrab / Nature’s Guardian no longer being exclusive are quite nice though healing is still your only real defensive; nothing new to answer stuns and their damage potential is possibly the only thing that might allow branching out of the Tubro comp, but it’s hard to say for sure.","Oct 25, 2022 11:03 pm",Shaman

"I am absolutely loving my enh shaman with a heavy focused Windfury build! It’s been a blast! The rotation feels good for my personal play style, for my gear and absolute lack of gems, enchants, buff food or pots and flasks in the low keystone I did today I was doing pretty good damage. I can’t imagine how great it’s going to feel with good gear, full enchants and gems, etc.","Oct 26, 2022 12:24 am",Shaman

"If you play all of those talents at the same time then I see your concern, however you can simplify the selection without losing much overall DPS, and with a smaller margin for error may even increase your DPS consistently with a simpler approach.
The option to CHOOSE to complicate a spec moreso to increase damage by making a more difficult build more rewarding with good execution is in my opinion excellent design.","Nov 18, 2022 6:11 am",Shaman
"Try going heavy into sundering and earthquake and not playing ice fury, or play master of elements without sundering and select all of the fire talents on the right side. Experiment!

You can be viable and effective simply with proper execution and the kicker is you will have fun playing your way.","Nov 18, 2022 7:15 am",Shaman
"I could see the argument that it’s good design if it was like that for all specs, but why would anyone want an over complicated spec when they can just look elsewhere","Nov 18, 2022 8:16 am",Shaman
"The point is that you can choose to make it not complicated, that’s what I mean. You don’t HAVE to take master of Elements, echoes of sundering AND icefury. You can take one of them if you want, or two! Whatever your comfortable with.

"Things get less explicit here and up for more debate. My personal suggestion is that Graceful Spirit reduces the cooldown of Spirit Walk by 15 seconds, and Spiritwalker’s Aegis grants an additional 2 removals of movement-impairing effects at 4 seconds and 8 seconds after the ability is cast. Since currently it requires 2 capstone talent points to reduce Spirit Walk to 45 seconds, a simple CD reduction attached to Graceful Spirit for Spirit Walk seems fair. Just like before, the second option is more worthwhile in PvP, but there is still a potential to beuseful in PvE content.","Nov 18, 2022 10:40 am",Shaman

"Go with the Flow would reduce the CD of Feral Lunge by 5 seconds per point, 10 seconds total. While I feel like this is not often worth the cost, very few people are using Go With the Flow currently, anyways. The rationale for Go with the Flow being 2 points is more of a macro talent tree design decision rather than a micro design decision.

"The current PvP identity:
Nearly universally, Shaman are considered the kill target in PvP. We deal strong damage and have great self-healing, but have little in the way of defensive abiliites. We don’t have a built-in everything immunity like Iceblock, partial immunity like Turtle Shell or Die by the Sword, or after-death spells like Restitution. We have a ton of utility which disrupts the enemy team’s flow of battle and strong self-heals that can keep us alive in a pinch.","Nov 17, 2022 1:38 am",Shaman
"What the identity is lacking in PvP: We were designed as the glass cannons of the Azeroth. We’re the Berserkers of the Vikings, Gladiator’s of the Romans. If we’re nearly universally going to be the kill target, we should also be topping the DPS charts if we’re ignored. We were designed to have incredible pressure, but we’re also designed to be anti-tank mines - why else would Windstrike ignore armor?","Nov 17, 2022 9:36 am",Shaman
"The problem: The problem is how we operate within PvE content. The idea of a glass cannon spec is terrible for raids, since healers keep us alive and our mobility allows us to maneuver around tricky AoE. Thus, our damage receives a massive nerf so DPS raid meta isn’t just filled with blue bars. I fully understand it’s necessary for PvE, but it distorts our identity in PvP. In Arenas if our damage is gutted, we’re really only viable in Turbocleave. Since utility is shared amongst all specs, an RBG team can get better healing out of a Resto and better damage out of an Ele if Enhancement damage is gutted. We simply become non-viable since a different spec can fill the position better.","Nov 17, 2022 10:30 am",Shaman
"As a side note, many specs have increased generic mobility built into the new talent trees that they can maintain damage and healing during. Shaman do not, as we don’t do much damage as a ghost wolf.","Nov 17, 2022 12:23 pm",Shaman
"My proposed “easy to implement and balance” solution is a new PvP talent:
Imprint of the Wolf: The Shaman singles out a target, Stormstrike increases its movement speed by 15% when moving towards the target and reducing the targets healing taken by 40%. Their intense focus on this target reduces damage by 10% to additional targets hit by the Shaman.","Nov 17, 2022 1:42 pm",Shaman
"Doesn’t have to be Storm Strike, but putting it on a cooldown could have the negative side effect of reduced damage when switching targets, particularly if the first wasn’t killed.","Nov 17, 2022 3:34 pm",Shaman
"It’s an identity driven talent that is essentially a mortal strike effect for Shaman. This would reduce the Shaman’s reliance on Warriors, making it viable in more arena compositions. The current comps for RBGs typically only contain two melee outside of the base-sitters, often a DK for their grips and a warrior for their mortal strike. This ability would help cement the spec identity Enhance in RBGs: paired with Windstrike, we would become legitimate anti-tank mines. With the increased movespeed, we could also stick to the tanks easier, which maintains the status quo of ‘kill the Shaman’ and makes us a threat at all levels of PvP.","Nov 17, 2022 4:05 pm",Shaman
"It changes nothing for PvE, and requires no additional talent balancing outside of balancing the mortal strike/move speed/collateral damage effect, and allows the nerfs to our baseline damage to have less of an effect in PvP content.","Nov 17, 2022 4:45 pm",Shaman

That is not an insignificant change and feels really bad and honestly makes me want to just go back to warrior main when I was really excited to play enhancement come DF.
