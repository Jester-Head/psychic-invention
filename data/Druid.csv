If so. why.","Nov 19, 2022 6:09 pm",Druid
"With the last few buffs they did to the bear we are now really only ever going too go into the right capstone area. The left is basically just useless now, There just isnt going to be an actual situation where i can see going to the left would be necessary.","Nov 13, 2022 11:31 am",Druid
"We cant give up sleeper or most of the moonfire talents at this point along with after the wildfire being as strong as it is, we just have too go that way.
Also with the rage generation bear has in DF ursocs guidance is a must aswell no matter the situation to have a 2min incarn.","Nov 13, 2022 12:21 pm",Druid
"I am happy for these buffs, just wish the tree was more routes in the tree too pick things easily like what other specs can do.","Nov 13, 2022 12:21 pm",Druid
I really wish Druid had the simplicity/layout that Warrior has for both it’s Class and Prot spec tree.,"Nov 13, 2022 12:24 pm",Druid
I really can’t see further changes until next patch cycle as this tuning is brute-forcing the spec out of bad design.,"Nov 13, 2022 12:28 pm",Druid

"Idk im soo bored with thrash, been doing that whole thing since bfa. it is rediculous how much dmg is only in moonfire though for aoe though. Single target with the last few changes maul does a significant amount of dmg.","Nov 14, 2022 7:32 am",Druid

"It’s an odd hodge-podge in the class tree as I wanted the extra range, speed & PotP.","Nov 14, 2022 9:41 am",Druid
"Likewise, the spec tree has the Maul focus along side a thin amount of capstone (worried it may be too thin tbh).","Nov 14, 2022 9:42 am",Druid
I don’t even like Moonfire spam and it feels bad to be sub optimal if I don’t go that route.,"Nov 14, 2022 9:50 am",Druid
"One the one hand, I agree.","Nov 14, 2022 9:58 am",Druid
"On the other hand, please shut up because if they try to fix it again they might just screw it up again, and having one excellent spec is better than having 3 mediocre ones!","Nov 14, 2022 10:17 am",Druid
"Having a massive amount of offensive power tied into a long range, long duration, cleaving ability, while incredibly weird for a BEAR, also feels incredibly good as a tank","Nov 14, 2022 10:28 am",Druid

"From a defensive perspective, bears look to be extremely durable with multiple builds.","Nov 14, 2022 10:40 am",Druid
Feral druid AOE DPS is lacking. Also it is lacking in my opinion. On single target DPS. Does anybody seen anything saying that they’re going to rework any of the talents and the talent tree or do anything to make them any better?,"Nov 18, 2022 12:08 pm",Druid
"You’re doing it wrong. Feral AoE is absolutely nuts. Feral has multiple build options to focus on ST, AoE, or a mix of both right now. It’s arguably the most versatile melee dps spec. Maybe go watch a guide, or maybe it’s just a L2P issue.","Nov 18, 2022 12:53 pm",Druid

I skipped Shadowlands and just came back. I’ve always felt like I can hit harder with my hunter or DK in 5 mans with blues than I can in moonkin in low level Raid or M+ gear.,"Nov 16, 2022 4:26 am",Druid
I don’t usually do 5 mans as Moonkin and usually use Guardian but the moonkins I see are consistently not good. I just finished a heroic with mosyly fresh 60’s and the meter looked like:,"Nov 16, 2022 10:17 am",Druid
The moonkin was legitimately 1/4 of the damage of the Evoker with better gear and the Evoker was in blues and just learning how to use it.,"Nov 16, 2022 1:57 pm",Druid
Sure Evoker hitting hard is expected right now but I don’t even remember the last time I tanked a dungeon and got beat by a mookin. In that run I didn’t even realize the update reset most my guardian talents and was still 2x the moonkin.,"Nov 16, 2022 8:58 pm",Druid
Boomkin just requires actual thought too play properly. Alot of boomkins really suck but there are a few great ones and they doo great dmg.,"Nov 17, 2022 7:04 am",Druid
Ran Ulduar this time with talents. Got another moonkin in back to back runs.,"Nov 18, 2022 5:57 am",Druid
The moonkin was directly in the middle between the healer and the next last DPS. This is not a rare occurrence it’s every time I have a moonkin in a dungeon group.,"Nov 18, 2022 7:20 am",Druid

"Maybe they’re returning players as well and are getting used to their new setups? I manage to pull DPS numbers just fine, though I will admit there is a bit of a struggle to do so sometimes. Our damage ramps up over long fights, as most of our DPS comes from placing DoTs on the target: Moonfire, Sunfire and Stellar Flare, followed by generating as much Astral Power as we can before dumping Starsurges into a target. That’s the basics of it, not including the addition of proc effects and cooldowns.","Nov 18, 2022 1:35 pm",Druid
"Confusion for the spec might come into play when doing specific groups, as in order to get buffs for our AoE cast, we first need to use our ST cast twice. This gives us Lunar Eclipse, buffing Starfire and Arcane Damage.","Nov 18, 2022 2:25 pm",Druid
"You are running low level content and saying that Boomkins are cringe, man, you play at a level where most people is extremely casual.","Nov 18, 2022 3:52 pm",Druid
"Boomkin is top dps on most M+ i have been doing lately, the only reason i dont play that spec is because i suck at it.","Nov 18, 2022 7:23 pm",Druid

"I’ve played a Prot Paladin the last couple expansions, and coming over to Guardian Druid, I can’t help but feel that Ironfur is just a travesty for the spec. With Shield of Righteousness, it’s actually part of your DPS rotation. So you’re actively doing decent AoE damage while also putting up your active mitigation buff.","Nov 14, 2022 5:43 pm",Druid
Ironfur is just a waste. It feels absolutely terrible to press. I have a few ideas on how to fix it:,"Nov 14, 2022 5:56 pm",Druid

Ironfur feels completely fine.,"Nov 15, 2022 11:23 am",Druid
Ironfur should at least give an aura so it’s easier to tell when its up (and look cool),"Nov 15, 2022 11:45 am",Druid
Ironfur realistically just needs to do a bit more too be a real tank mechanic. Something like giving a small percentage based heal or shield on use.,"Nov 15, 2022 3:16 pm",Druid
"I dont really think it should do dmg, or atleast if it did make it just reflect a small amount of dmg or do a small burst of dmg on use.
There probably should have been some actually cool talents that combo with ironfur to make it do more instead of just have a trashy 10% chance to gain another fur or 8% more armor on ironfur.","Nov 15, 2022 3:46 pm",Druid
"Dude, just don’t tank. Go DPS. Clearly you don’t understand the mechanics/principles of tanking","Nov 15, 2022 3:50 pm",Druid
"That’s quite the aggressive assumption based on my post. I’m well aware of the mechanics of tanking. You’ve failed to provide an argument against what I wrote, and instead decided to insult me. Bizarre childlike behavior.","Nov 15, 2022 4:39 pm",Druid
Ironfur is as exiting to press as Demon Spikes or ShieldBlock/ignore pain,"Nov 15, 2022 5:54 pm",Druid
"At some point the tank role was redesigned so that each tank spec has what is called “active mitigation”, where outside of large defensive cooldowns, players must now actively use short defensive abilities to mitigate damage. Every tank spec has one of these, it is not unique to just Guardian Druid’s Ironfur as someone in this thread has already pointed out. These abilities do just that, reduces damage you take. It was never intended to be an ability that does directly damage.","Nov 15, 2022 6:06 pm",Druid
"You are complaining about an active mitigation ability not doing any damage. You further go on to state that it should be entirely passive, which defeats the purpose. You’re proposing tanks play exactly like a DPS role that has extreme passive mitigation. Except this already exists via armor, passives that greatly reduce damage taken already, and things like dodge/parry/block.","Nov 15, 2022 6:11 pm",Druid
"Sorry, your request to just fully DPS as a tank spec and take zero damage is a pipe dream. Its not going to happen. As a tank, you need to have some kind of thought input on when to use your abilities to reduce incoming damage. That is what separates a good tank from a bad tank.","Nov 15, 2022 6:15 pm",Druid
"My suggestion to you is to kindly educate yourself on the tank role, or just play a DPS instead. Tanking isn’t for everyone.","Nov 15, 2022 6:19 pm",Druid

What he’s asking for isn’t out of the ordinary.,"Nov 15, 2022 6:21 pm",Druid
Guardian druids already had this option in BFA through the use of azerite traits. Each stack of Ironfur granted us a stackable agility buff along with it. Making Ironfur an active part of our dps.,"Nov 15, 2022 6:33 pm",Druid
"Furthermore, there are traits, talents and covenant abilities that passively stack Ironfur. Its not a strange request. These things exist.","Nov 15, 2022 6:36 pm",Druid
"As I noted previously, I came to Guardian after playing Prot Paladin the last two expansions. Shield of Righteousness is an active mitigation ability that also does damage. It feels much better than pressing Iron Fur. That is literally the entire point of the thread.","Nov 19, 2022 12:25 pm",Druid

"What most of us are complaining about is how the druid trees are as compared to some of the other trees. For example, I tank on 5 toons. Warrior, Druid, DH, DK, and Pally. Warrior’s class and spec trees IMO are the gold standard. Not because they are overpowered, but because I feel I can really customize the build to how I want to play. The problem with the druid trees is that you almost have to look at one or two talents you are interested in on the last tier, and make a concerted effort to pick a good path there.","Nov 4, 2022 1:01 pm",Druid

Wildfire might’ve been buffed into being too strong. Berserk is nearly a healing CD if you’re getting increased rage from mangle so that you can pump out more group heals. I expect it will get tuned.,"Nov 17, 2022 1:17 pm",Druid

"I’m overall not very happy with the state of bear druid, but I’ll play it anyway just because I love druids thematically and they won’t let a tank sit in a bad position for too long. (We might still be the “worst tank” but they generally keep all tanks pretty competitive)","Nov 17, 2022 3:58 pm",Druid
"I’m finding guardian to be very capable. I’m not saying I’m 100% happy with everything.
The class tree is mostly junk for guardian. you end up spending points on useless talents to get to the few you want, since we can’t easy drop bear form while tanking. Guardian tree is a bit of a mess and could definitely use a reorganization (like why is Elune’s Favored not in the right side of the tree, and why is blood frenzy on the ride side of the tree with moonfire when trash talents are on the left?). But after lots of trying different builds and the recent buffs, I’m happy with the build I""m running on the beta servers. Would I change some things, absolutely. But its in a good enough spot for me to still main guardian/resto, and my warrior will be 2nd tank.","Nov 17, 2022 5:35 pm",Druid
"There is a little flexibility with builds if you are creative. If you try to rebuild what SL had with the talent trees, you’ll be a be disappointed. If you look outside of that, there is some crafting you can do. For example, I’m not running incarn (hated it in SL), so instead went far left and right of the tree.","Nov 17, 2022 6:09 pm",Druid

"And with the recent buffs, I’m actually quite enjoying the class now that I’ve worked in Dream of Cenarius and Wildfire into my builds.

im new to resto druid and tinkering around with the spec. I see this moonkin form and kinda dont get it? is it suppose to be used like a defensive cooldown or is there something else im missing about it. Pretty much every heal kicks me out of the form so im wondering if there is another use to it im missing since i could easily just switch to bear form and get better defense,"Nov 13, 2022 9:56 am",Druid
Oh moonkin form is purely for doing dmg with astral spells like starfire and starsurge.,"Nov 13, 2022 10:23 am",Druid

"Its time is running out soon, but if you want to have a little bit of fun before pre patch is over, try this. There is a bug with the legendary Dark Titans Lesson that allows you to cast Lifebloom in Moonkin Form.

You can heal fairly decently just like this and never leave Moonkin form.","Nov 13, 2022 5:18 pm",Druid
"Well this guy went a step further lol I was just gonna suggest going into moonkin form for convoke the spirits if you are in that covenant/talent and it will prefer to cast dps spells, so you can do sort of a dps cooldown.","Nov 13, 2022 6:50 pm",Druid

So Rip dmg still seems kinda low for me. I’ve buffed the crap out of it with talents and still single target dmg is sooo lacking behind FB. Granted I don’t have BT yet since with the build I’ve made can’t have it until 70. But that overall will just make FB stronger as well. It’s just a little disheartening because I heard feral is going back to revolving around bleeds and not a bite bot for DF but I don’t see it.,"Nov 16, 2022 9:07 am",Druid
Here’s ^ the build I’m going to run/made. It’s mainly for pvp so for pve going to throw around 1 or 2 points but overall still the same (other than making a straight aoe build),"Nov 16, 2022 9:20 pm",Druid
What do my fellow druids think? Buff Rip dmg?,"Nov 16, 2022 9:25 pm",Druid

"Also, Rip damage is fine if properly managed with bloodtalons.","Nov 17, 2022 10:22 am",Druid
I really don’t think they can buff rip damage. With primal wrath our damage would sky rocket. Bite will probably always out do rip in single target.,"Nov 17, 2022 10:24 am",Druid
But with rip and rake you want to put them on as many targets as possible. Do that and the damage will start rolling in.,"Nov 17, 2022 11:04 am",Druid

I’m not talking about AOE. I’m talking about single target. Feral has a very simple AOE build right now for pve. They could nerf primal wrath rip. Like if rip is on more than 2-3 targets the dmg gets reduced. Ez fix.,"Nov 17, 2022 1:46 pm",Druid

Why you agains it. I mean it could give a great AoE dmg for feral who would like to go into that direction. Also its stupid to open its path to all if its still locked behind Resto and Balance. Like dont open the path at all in that case,"Oct 6, 2022 2:09 am",Druid

Feral seems to be doing solid dps in cat form alone on df anyway. Having to ‘weave’ was due to energy starvation and no silly mana cost for shifting (like in wrath),"Oct 7, 2022 4:57 pm",Druid

It already feels awkward having to waste an extra two talent points just to get the extra 5 yard radius.

"Not to mention the fact that balance druids need to waste a class talent going into improved sunfire anyway.

Having the spec built around full moon and its lesser versions would be pretty interesting. I never understood why they decided to replace insect swarm with sunfire.,"Oct 9, 2022 10:36 pm",Druid
Both moonfire and sunfire are just fire and forget dots. They dont do anything interesting they dont work with anything. I would rather have moonfire do twice as much damage and remove sunfire imo.
