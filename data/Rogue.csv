"We got sub rogue buffs boys and girls! I don’t know that much about sub as I only stick to assassination. But I was hoping to try and perhaps switch over to sub. With the buffs it got for the November 22 tuning, do you sub rogues think it will be enough to make sub feel like it’s in a good spot?","Nov 19, 2022 9:48 am",Rogue

"Rogue not are particularly know for their AoE and cleave damage. Which is what dungeons are all about. Any DPS is good enough to get through the boss fights.

"But Assassination Rogues are, at least to my cursory examination, the only class and spec where if we take a specific capstone ability, in this case, Dragon Tempered Blades, it locks us out of any other capstone ability.","Nov 19, 2022 7:45 am",Rogue
"Even Beast Mastery Hunters, with the Dire Pack capstone ability costing 6 of their last 10 spec talent points (and thus comparable to Dragon Tempered Blades, which also costs 6 of our last 10 talent spec points), can still pick up one other capstone ability, due to the talent point cost of getting to them either being 2 or 3 talent points.","Nov 19, 2022 10:43 am",Rogue

I don’t know maybe it’s just me and I’ve done something incorrect but pretty sure every spec of other classes and this one can reach the bottom tier talent except this one.

DTB might just be. It synergizes with many talents.,"Nov 12, 2022 12:25 pm",Rogue
"This doubles the value of every talent that effects poisons. Venomous wounds, improved poisons, Fatal concoction, Dashing scoundrel, twist the knife. It also buffs some others just not as much like Zoldyck recipe, Improved shiv.","Nov 12, 2022 12:57 pm",Rogue
It gives a 4% buff to all dmg because of Lethal Dose.,"Nov 12, 2022 12:58 pm",Rogue
And it gives deadly poison in PVP which is probably like 10% dmg increase.,"Nov 12, 2022 1:00 pm",Rogue
So the talent alone probably gives like 20% extra dmg in value. Its that strong. It probably just depends on strong Kingbane and Serrated bones spike/sepsis are in comparison.,"Nov 12, 2022 1:14 pm",Rogue
"The current meta DTB build after the 11/11 buffs doesn’t take most poison-related talents. Skips Vicious Venoms, TTK, and TTB.","Nov 12, 2022 1:43 pm",Rogue

To me the most fun I have ever had playing this game was as a sub rogue in Legion using death from above; allowing us to funnel all of our aoe damage into priority damage. it felt dynamic and potent.

Yes I understand that. Mentioning DfA was more along the lines of something I wish they would bring back to add some unique flavor back to the sub specialization.

Realistically I started this thread to open up discussion as to where the rogue community at large would like to see the identity go. What ideas there may be to give the spec something of its own in terms of playstyle altering mechanics. Or if people whole heartily disagree with my view of the situation. Please change my mind. Explain why and what is giving sub a unique identity.,"Nov 16, 2022 11:44 pm",Rogue
"Yah, I completely agree. I don’t know where it could really go. At this point, the only thing making it unique is shadow magic. Which, I am not a huge fan of. I do like the idea of using magic. But, not offensively. Dealing shadow damage is weird.","Nov 17, 2022 7:33 am",Rogue
"I have very conflicted feelings on Shadow Dance being in the class tree. On one hand, Shadow Dance is such a powerful ability, it could be argued the other specs will never compare in PVP to Subtlety without it. On the other hand, it’s just such a core Subtlety ability. Subtlety is suppose to be the “Stealth” spec.
It also really bugs me that nothing huge from the other specs was shared. I mean, Assassination didn’t have anything super cool, I suppose. But, why the heck isn’t Adrenaline Rush in the class tree? I mean, who the heck wanted Thistle Tea and Echoing Reprimand to not only be in the class tree, but be capstone talents!? Sorry, bit off topic…","Nov 17, 2022 7:36 am",Rogue

Recently I leveled up an awesome Pandaren Outlaw Rogue (Sawblades on Azgalor). And I LOVE em. Leveled him up almost exclusively through Battlegrounds.

"The current iteration of Deathmark feels pretty bad to press. If you are playing improved garrote, you are forced to use Deathmark as an opener in order to double 50% garrote. You also have to reapply bleeds to make deathmark of any benifit. That and deathmark itself does very pitiful damage.","Oct 26, 2022 1:26 am",Rogue
"I suggest that Deathmark refresh current bleeds and poisons on the target (minus Kingsbane, as that would be pretty broken) and then duplicate them along with its current effects of copying new bleeds you apply. That way you can use Deathmark as a burst button as it was intended.","Oct 26, 2022 5:31 am",Rogue
Agreed. Its almost like that talent was rushed in,"Oct 26, 2022 5:37 am",Rogue
"Yeah it feels clunky to press, did they say why vendetta had to get reworked?","Oct 26, 2022 7:35 am",Rogue
"Seems fine to me. Vanish lines up so you always have a full Garrote Rupture to apply. With improved Garrote, you can Ambush Garrote for more CPs in openers.","Oct 26, 2022 4:13 pm",Rogue

Rupture and Garotte will last the full duration of Deathmark - 16 seconds. You shouldn’t have to worry about refreshing either.,"Oct 29, 2022 11:29 pm",Rogue
you have to use deathmark before you apply bleeds. It specifically says bleeds applied after the buff are duplicated.,"Oct 29, 2022 11:56 pm",Rogue

I agree Blizz instead of perma removing it, could give an alternative for all spec, not only Sub… Oh, wait, it’s actually what Blizz did! Sin have SnD refreshed after CP finisher, Outlaw have 1 hour of its duration, so he/she forget SnD exist, and Sub got it automatically at the beggining of every fight thx to Premeditation!
And look! With the new talent system you are not forced to choose between Prem and other viable abilities, because it cost only 1 talent point on a huge tree of points!
With all that in mind, the fans of the classic WoW abilities still can use it, and the game is fun for them too, not only for players don’t like SnD!","Jul 13, 2022 12:16 pm",Rogue

One of that kind of ability is Between the Eyes - so cool, thematic and satisfied after pressing it in Legion, now reduce to some crit buff.","Jul 13, 2022 3:58 pm",Rogue
SnD as an active ability is not fun or exciting. It makes way more sense to have it as a passive.,"Jul 13, 2022 4:42 pm",Rogue
"I mean I think SnD should be a passive, not gotten rid of.","Jul 13, 2022 4:59 pm",Rogue
I play Assassination so SnD is press once at the beginning of the fight and maintain it by envenoming. It was an important ability back in Vanilla but were at the point where it really should just be a passive that occurs once we use a combo spender attacks and combo points spenders add to its duration.,"Jul 13, 2022 5:20 pm",Rogue
"It’s up to the Outlaw to decide if they want to use it then. Easy decision there for them . Us rogues adapt from moment to moment, maybe you want to hold a few seconds as a wave of bads are coming up , maybe we have a priority enemy to nuke, maybe a fresh SnD is useful here to get some life back (if you have recuperate) and just rolled that buff for leech (can’t remember as I am not an outlaw rogue). The point is having tools to use instead of pruning us. They make it passive then they would nerf it down the road because of some dumb streamer abusing it. It’s all up to us to decide when to use something appropriately.","Jul 13, 2022 9:48 pm",Rogue

"Serrated Bone spike DOT (covenant ability from being necrolord, NOT the talent itself) disappears after 2-3 seconds on a target (tested on multiple mobs in Revendereth).

"Duskwalker’s Patch legendary does NOT reduce Deathmark cooldown (tooltip still says Vendetta) but supposedly all the guides said it does reduce Deathmark cd, but I just tested on Turnip in ORIBOS (yes I made sure I was in SL) and timed Deathmark on my iphone, took entire 2 mins to refresh its CD while I was spamming abilities on dummy). Essentially a completely usless legendary.","Oct 28, 2022 1:42 am",Rogue
"Combo points appear and then disappear on targets many times in Battlegrounds. I’ll build like 4 cp’s on a target and without using a finisher at all, will reduce to 1-2 cps. very buggy.","Oct 29, 2022 8:11 pm",Rogue
