"I’ve been waiting for Gnome Paladins and Druids for 18 years now. I remember when people argued against Tauren Rogues- know because “hooves” lol
Since Gnomes are warriors and recently learned to be priest - it only makes sense that the next Gnome class in a Paladin. In fact, it could be a cool storyline quest to unlock it. A warrior Gnome, injured in battle, is being healed by a Gnome priest in the Wetlands. She teaches him about the light and “we” as travelers need to help him on his quest to believing in the Light. At the end the priest gives him an artifact of the Light and he’s reborn a Paladin. Doing this storyline quest could unlock the Paladin class for Gnomes and for Goblins. This would be cool to see in game. AND once you create your “New” Paladin Gnome or Goblin and reach level 10, you’ll get an auto quest to go see him and he’ll give you an awesome shield.","Nov 16, 2022 7:46 pm",Paladin

"Unpopular opinion, but I don’t even think there needs to be a big lore event / justification for it. There can be outsiders. It’s silly imo to think an entire race will completely ignore a particular combat path just because they “generally” don’t fit the vibe. I don’t think there needs to be a sudden interest in Gnome society in the Paladin arts; it can be as simple as a Gnome who is friends with a Dwarf Paladin is like “ayo man teach me that hammer stuff” and he does.","Nov 17, 2022 4:29 pm",Paladin

""" The most inaccurate thing said at times, and the most hurtful, is that the developers don’t care. The entire team cares passionately and are deeply rewarded by the joy of their players, and want to make everyone happy. If they’re unable to act on feedback, it’s often because they’re balancing the concerns and requests of a very diverse player base that has different goals, different motivations, and often directly conflicting desires. Doing the thing that person A requests could make the game worse for person B and vice versa because they play the game in different ways and want to experience the game in different ways.

"Ion, paladin has been abused by the dragonflight talent system. 2317 posts in the official paladin forums, last official post IIRC is # 215. What did we gain from the talent swaps? Broken class Identity, loss of utility (due to competition with mandatory throughput), Loss of rotational smoothness among all 3 specs, worse mobility, and less defensives.","Nov 17, 2022 8:52 pm",Paladin

This expansion was touted as the “We are hearing you, the players” expansion. Go to the beta forum (the only forum that matters, because Live and DF are entirely different beasts) and you will notice that the same topics have been resounded since the beginning:
We don’t like Of Dusk and Dawn. We don’t like AS not generating HP / Judgement for Holy. We don’t like that we put 3 point into steed, and it is still the weakest mobility in the game. Retribution should not revolve around consecreation at all.
Whats worse is that not a single spec of Paladins is currently top tier in any relevant content, be PVP or PVE and the changes proposed won’t catapult them into S+ territory, hell I would argue not even A tier territory, but it WOULD mean a lot to players that their concerns are heard. Even if it was a resounding NO and GET SCREWED, that would at LEAST be communication. So far? No communication for months. And Paladins as a whole, I think got the entirety of 2 blue posts throughout the entire beta??? I think other classes get 2 blue posts per week.","Nov 18, 2022 12:48 pm",Paladin

From an arena players perspective:,"Nov 18, 2022 5:10 am",Paladin
"I love my paladin and I don’t plan on swapping in DF but picking talents really does feel bad. The spec just feels weaker as the only way to get previously baseline abilities is to spec into them and this leaves you feeling like you’re always missing something, although you could argue that’s good talent design. For me though, missing the buttons that should be baseline feels bad and I hope they don’t just hamfist give rets more dam to compensate (Although make no mistake, I love me some big dam). Consecration talents and Radiant Decree are the only things that feel “New” and being able to also play JV/Blind/Rep seems fun.","Nov 18, 2022 10:17 am",Paladin
"Ret excels when it’s a fast meta and is typically dog when the meta is slow, I can’t comment on what geared arena is going to feel like at 70 though. It’s my bro theory they left ret largely untouched in Slands arena because it was already considered dog in pve.

• Tower of Radiance - Flash or Light on your Beacon +1 holy power.

Yes that’s the caster build. But no it’s not as favored as the melee build as it has less dps and similar hps. Paladins prefer to holy shock and Cs to build HP and then use LoD to group heal.

As caster, you are in melee range 99% of the time anyway, key difference between caster and melee build, is that you have the freedom to leave melee range when necessary, and if you do leave melee range, your healing does not drop off a cliff.","Nov 3, 2022 3:04 pm",Paladin

Maybe druids should be forced in bear or cat to improve their healing, no, because it doesn’t make sense. Why is required for paladins to do so then?

Our dmg abilities are also all melee and your group is going to expect you to be doing dmg. I average 8k dps in keys overall, its significant enough dmg that its worth the effort that 10mil dmg is less dmg your dps has to do in the long run. What you guys are missing is that holy pally shifted away from caster build years ago, and there was a good reason for it. You carry a sword and shield and also shield of righteous is valuable to cast because increases your armor by 4.774 and does AOE dmg and can be a good filler when the group is topped off on healing. Every healer does dmg in keys, and holy pally is expected to do the same.

Now that it’s damage is ~ on par with those and the cost is the same there is no logical reason to not make JV a passive that works with either TV or FV. It being a separate spell is the prime example for button bloat.
Sure, there are talents that affect TV/FV and not JV but realistically those are so minor that they are negligible. Simply adjust the healing portion accordingly. Make it 80 or 90%.

I think they made JV like that as an alternative build to TV/FV. You can basically replace TV with it and skip all the related TV/FV talents for other talents instead.

I do bgs more than any other content and I just keep crusader on all the time. 3% damage reduction doesn’t do anything and the ret “aura” is too situational.,"Nov 1, 2020 3:40 pm",Paladin
"Divine Toll for Holy Paladins does not seem to target your team for the other 4 casts when selecting a friendly player to heal. It just randomly attacks enemies too, which is a big nerf to healing.","Nov 14, 2022 8:55 pm",Paladin
"Yea, it’s really annoying. I submitted several bug reports on this last week and was a little bummed to not see it fixed with today’s patch.","Nov 15, 2022 11:39 pm",Paladin
I only ever use it for damage. Kinda sucks that I am ret and I almost always do more healing than I do damage in BGs. Ive seen a few rets who are like that as well.,"Nov 17, 2022 3:18 am",Paladin
"As Prot, it sometimes dont generate HP for every mob hit, and it doesnt cast on mobs behind me, as used to do. Also, at times it doesnt proc on mobs damaged just by consecration, only the ones i directly hit with other skills.","Nov 17, 2022 5:50 am",Paladin
So what i found was for mouseover healing it is screwed but if you actually select a party member and have them as your target it seems to only affect your allies (5 man group is what i was in),"Nov 17, 2022 11:04 am",Paladin
"I’ve never been much of a paladin player, but I’m considering a tank alt for DF, and one of the things that I’m interested in learning more about is this Tank/healer hybrid for pallies because I anticipate it being good for epic BGs like AV.","Nov 17, 2022 10:27 am",Paladin
"Could someone give me a simple breakdown of why Prot is a “healer” in Shuffle? Would queueing as Prot in AV, and [if there’s a better tank] healing instead be viable? Explain it like I’m 5.","Nov 17, 2022 10:36 am",Paladin
"Prot Paladin WoG’s hit for an insane amount, can generate HP (In Shadowlands) with Blessed Hammer ( doesn’t require a target ) and Avenger’s shield (not applicable in DF).","Nov 17, 2022 10:38 am",Paladin
"They do decent DPS, have massive heals and a kick and a silence and every 45 seconds they get 4 seconds of immunity through Memory of the Endless Kings.","Nov 17, 2022 11:02 am",Paladin
Really appreciate the response.,"Nov 17, 2022 11:03 am",Paladin
"Is it realistic to say if I’m the 4th best tank in AV, as a Prot Pally, I could just drop back and heal and help the team? Or would I be a liability?","Nov 17, 2022 11:04 am",Paladin
"I’m not an avid PvP’er, but I think you would be better off in the front lines. This way you can continue to generate Holy Power through Judgement and Hammer, but also provide group heals through Consecration+Path talent and being in range for Divine Toll. You are also a tank so you will soak a lot of incoming damage that would likely kill a non-tank.","Nov 17, 2022 11:04 am",Paladin
"Literally out dmged and outhealed by a warlock and a shadow priest on beta. Nice job blizzard. You killed the spec, compared to other specs and class prot has also the least options for its talent tree, the tree is half the warriors one in number of options, how can you guys shut your eyes like this. WAKE UP ! This is a call to action and you must do something to bring protection paladin back to its place for the past 6 years.","Nov 16, 2022 10:16 am",Paladin
"I am honestly and very quickly losing interest. The interview today named the blood dk as a spec to receive more revisions. I laughed so hard, one of the top 3 tanks, among the best contenders and literally the only tank that did not get affected by the massive 40% change, is getting closer examinations, but Paladins, dead last on tanks? The one that universally got screwed by the change? Screw em apparently.","Nov 16, 2022 6:06 pm",Paladin

Test it on live damage and self heal is OK but avengers should not generating holy power feels very bad.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:41 am",Paladin
It handicapped the spec and feels something is holding me back from doing my rotation. It feels very slow to play,"Nov 17, 2022 4:50 am",Paladin
my spells are doing 4.3k dmg instead of 5.4k + last week dude wtf,"Nov 16, 2022 6:16 pm",Paladin
They did nerf you (and ret). Seal of Reprisal was changed from increasing Holy Power spenders damage by 10% to increasing the damage of CS/HotR/BH by 10%. A rather significant nerf.,"Nov 16, 2022 6:32 pm",Paladin
"not what i meant, i never even used that talent in the first place. any top player knew it sucked anyways for raid and pvp and solo content. it was only good for m+ which i dont do. what i say is that reduced our dmg by a good 1k with the update for no reason and healing too. like I saw my hammers tooltip say it hit for 5.404 holy dmg and now it does 4963 holy dmg which is awful its under the minimum i do 4k dps this spec is unplayable","Nov 16, 2022 6:35 pm",Paladin
Maybe they also fixed the Hallowed Ground talent? Used to incorrectly buff all Holy damage by 10%. That would match the damage numbers you are seeing.,"Nov 16, 2022 6:36 pm",Paladin
There was a lot of changes. But i am not sure there are any patch notes.,"Nov 16, 2022 6:53 pm",Paladin
i didn’t use that one either dude. Im telling you they just flat out nerfed us without telling us why or mentionning it. They do that sometimes and i hate them for it.,"Nov 16, 2022 7:08 pm",Paladin
"Oh i belive you. As i said, there was a lot of changes. Arcane Mages got some buffs for example. But for some reason there are no official patch notes. Or at least none that i can find.","Nov 16, 2022 11:32 pm",Paladin
Edit: Disc priest even got some major talent changes.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:36 am",Paladin
