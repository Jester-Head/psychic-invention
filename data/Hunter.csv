Wildfire bombs is one the most fun abilities in the toolkit you leap forwards or back launching pyrotechnics into some ones face. We have a few staby staby moves and the class feels pretty good the more bomb procs you get and see your numbers go up like crazy. But hear me out i think we are ok with the 2 charges 2 aoe melee skills and a single target melee skills and we have 3 arrow skills.,"Nov 19, 2022 11:40 am",Hunter
What im geting at is…we need a second grenade skill that hear me out my idea replaces or competes with Aspect of the Eagle. It hits 2 targets for the same damage as a arcane shot damage each for 15-20 focus and it can reduce the CD of wildfire bombs by a 1sec per cast with a 40yrd range. Call it Wildfire Cherry bombs or Grenades.,"Nov 19, 2022 2:17 pm",Hunter
Idea is better survivability at anytime your hp low and mongoose bite not cutting it and you need to kite because health low and cooldowns are long because i dont see how 15sec on mongoose bite is enough on an min and a half CD in an ever changing environment.,"Nov 19, 2022 3:03 pm",Hunter

Have you seen the size those dragons it fine if you want to use bows or little guns only lad but we aren’t hunting normal wild game. You should be asking where is the armor piecing rounds and rocket launchers. Don’t you know survival hunter is the new big game hunter now lad its why i hunt with large spear you need make deeper wounds for monsters. Also when you hunt people you want kill them fast your not looking to skin them and eat there meat of course im going use bombs.","Nov 19, 2022 3:24 pm",Hunter

"i mean, BM is literally the only spec that is somewhat intact except it’s just ol’ BM with a little more CC.","Nov 12, 2022 7:31 pm",Hunter
"Marks is terrible and a shell of it’s former self. What used to be a high skill cap decent spec is now turned into some ZUG ZUG abomination of 30 second cooldowns and easily the second worst designed spec mechanically. You feel nothing when playing this spec, there’s no setup or reward anymore, this is literally the worst state the spec has ever been in.","Nov 12, 2022 8:15 pm",Hunter
"Survival. oh survival… remember up there when i said MM was the second worst designed spec, GUESS WHICH IS THE WORST. Yep. Not only is survival even worse now, i mean each iteration of survival just gets worse how do they even accomplish that, but it literally plays mechanically like a vegetarian BBQ cook off. I mean i gave it a good chance, i really tried, the best i could get working was a wildfire bomb focused setup, but it’s just bad. sooooooo badddddd.","Nov 12, 2022 9:26 pm",Hunter
"I look at classes like DK, and it’s like there isnt enough points to even get half the talents you’d want and would be amazing. And then i look at MM and Surv and it’s like more than have the choices feel like they have covid and i dont even want to go near them they are so bad. And the talents that seem good, completely conflict with each other so if you pick them both your whole gameplay flow rotation and everything about it just goes out the window and feels and plays terribly. They dont compliment each other at all. Especially in Survival. I mean they weren’t even good enough designers to make one side of the tree maybe melee focused and the other bombs and traps and ranged. It’s a mess. And not like birthday cake puke mess, this is like sushi puke mess.","Nov 12, 2022 9:52 pm",Hunter
Hunter is by far the worst talent trees of all by a far margin.,"Nov 12, 2022 10:14 pm",Hunter
"I’ve literally mained MM hunter for over 4 years now…that and naturally Warlock. I don’t like where the talent tree for it is now and I definitely want my “Barrage” back without making it to max level yet again but if there’s nerfs in the tree structure beyond that I’m not actually seeing them…it’s a scrambled mess and talents need to be returned to their pre prepatch level but it’s functional within boundaries…Mutishot and Barrage are too far down the tree, and this is a complaint I have with a few talent trees. 80% playable…so every bit as bad as the last level squish IMO. As for the other specs? I’m not familiar enough to comment. I’ve tried survival for about six levels…then frankly just gave up, not a huge fan of BM but I can make it work.","Nov 12, 2022 10:41 pm",Hunter

"If you’re a good player you will still get into groups and out dps most people that just strive for meta. Hunter look bleaks right now but I doubt they will let it be like this the entire expansion. If both players are equal skill level you’re kinda screwed dps wise though, fortunately that is very rare unless you’re in a top tier mythic guild which most people posting on the forums aren’t in.","Nov 18, 2022 10:18 pm",Hunter

"first off, our biggest problem isnt damage, that’s not to say damage isnt a huge problem, but our trees are abysmal. Because they are so bad, our mechanics are so bad. we have two working builds for MM atm, one is completely single target, the other is completely AOE. So any situation you’re in that requires the other, you’re dead in the water. And then comes our damage problem. Even when we are in the perfect situation, our damage is still worse than most classes. So if you take a full Mythic+ run you will come to the realization that we are garbage cans as MM.","Nov 19, 2022 4:50 pm",Hunter

"Current version of SV hunter is a bad design, and I don’t care what people talk about it’s a bad design. Not because it’s melee, it’s because it butchered to the point I would rather see ranged SV back then blizzard working like this on the spec.","Nov 17, 2022 9:33 am",Hunter
"No one loved the play style with tier sets, when we had to fish for procs to get that bi damage, and blizzard continued to the trend. KC resets reduce the cooldown, or they increase the duration or they have a chance to trigger something. Why? Why being so lazy with class design. I hate to say it but Bepples was right when he said that they took from other specs and just copy pasted to SV hunter, in order to fill the pack of abilities. Not in these words but something like this.","Nov 17, 2022 10:05 am",Hunter
Discord SV hunters follow guides that literally makes you use focus regenerating abilities while you’re at full focus. And mongoose spam has become more prominent than ever before. I’m sorry but that’s the fact. I’ll rather have ranged SV back then devs keep making mess like they do right now with SV hunter,"Nov 17, 2022 11:07 am",Hunter
"We’ve already seen that Blizzard can get people to jump on the SV bandwagon, just by tuning up the numbers. It lessens the incentive for Blizzard to actually put in real effort with class design.","Nov 17, 2022 12:42 pm",Hunter
Exactly. Big numbers are not the solution,"Nov 17, 2022 12:47 pm",Hunter
Survival was fun UNTIL the set bonus. Fishing for procs is awful. My favorite version was in bfa managing focus around mongoose bite. Havent played it much prepatch but it looks like it would be similar.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:05 pm",Hunter
Right now ST is like that. You manage your focus around mongoose furry stacks. But AOE is garbage. It revolves too much around chances when kill command resets.,"Nov 17, 2022 2:17 pm",Hunter
I’m sorry which guides are saying this? Because sv right now its never ok to overcap on focus.,"Nov 17, 2022 3:23 pm",Hunter
Maybe someone was recommending using kc during pheromone bomb to reduce the cd of fury for more up time on it but i can only see thats being valuable during aoe after your’ve used everything.,"Nov 17, 2022 3:55 pm",Hunter

"SV hunter doesn’t need to go back to range to be great again (shut up Bepples). Blizzard needs to focus on what it core was originally designed around, bleeds, poisions, and traps.","Nov 17, 2022 4:36 pm",Hunter

its almost to a point where melee survival is more of a beast master hunter than beast master is a beast master hunter. i dunno where blizzard is going with this.,"Nov 17, 2022 8:27 pm",Hunter
I don’t hate the tree as much i dont think we lack focus from abilities unless they tune KC damage i don’t think we need to fish for them more just for extra damage because you be spamming mongoose bite for single target damage. Maybe if it was a free KC that just launches on proc like serpent sting then i can see free to spam mongoose bite more.,"Nov 17, 2022 8:56 pm",Hunter
I feel like we need a talent that allows mongoose bite to hit up to 2 targets and then to 3 for like 60-70% damage the focus target get hit with instead upping the chance for more KC. AND have all our melee abilities default to 8yrd because we are spear masters we have reach. That we can up to 11yards with lunge.,"Nov 17, 2022 9:33 pm",Hunter

"if you want to get in range sometimes to take potshots at other melees, you don’t need to equip a bow. survival can weave in and out of melee by applying dots and picking up range-oriented talents–aspect of the eagle, wildfire bomb build, basically all of the capstone talents in the class tree. you’ll still deal your best damage while in melee, but you can definitely deal damage at range without relying on stuff that’s not “for” survival.","Nov 19, 2022 7:28 am",Hunter
