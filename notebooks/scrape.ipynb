I’m trying to narrow down which class I’d like to focus on first in DF. My limited time sort of pigeon holes me in 1 class at a time. With that, I am wondering if DPS DK is looking pretty good for DF?   \n",
       "1                       I think both Frost and Unholy feel really fun to play. Unholy got a ton of single target and AoE burst, with satisfying setup and execution. Also think Unholy scales the best in AoE for any class in the game. Frost is a beast when it comes to cleave, don’t think anything can beat it at 2 targets. Fast-paced with quick CD windows and big hits!   \n",

I’ve been playing around a little bit with frost DK, mainly just questing and doing the timewalking dungeons. I like the feel of frost, but I’ve also been doing such trivial stuff with it, that I’m not sure if it is a good precursor to anything.   \n",
