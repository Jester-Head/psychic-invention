post_1,"Hey all! I came back to the game a few weeks ago, so I am pretty far behind the loop here. I’m trying to narrow down which class I’d like to focus on first in DF. My limited time sort of pigeon holes me in 1 class at a time. With that, I am wondering if DPS DK is looking pretty good for DF?",2,"Nov 11, 2022 1:02 pm"
post_2,"I think both Frost and Unholy feel really fun to play. Unholy got a ton of single target and AoE burst, with satisfying setup and execution. Also think Unholy scales the best in AoE for any class in the game. Frost is a beast when it comes to cleave, don’t think anything can beat it at 2 targets. Fast-paced with quick CD windows and big hits!",8,"Nov 11, 2022 1:03 pm"
post_3,"Awesome! I’ve been playing around a little bit with frost DK, mainly just questing and doing the timewalking dungeons. I like the feel of frost, but I’ve also been doing such trivial stuff with it, that I’m not sure if it is a good precursor to anything.",0,"Nov 11, 2022 1:07 pm"
post_4,Warrior is fine if you don’t have a meter installed right now,2,"Nov 11, 2022 1:26 pm"
post_5,Great! I honestly haven’t played Unholy since WotLK (I took several years-long hiatuses after WotLK); does it play like a DoT management?,1,"Nov 11, 2022 1:30 pm"
post_6,"with superstrain, plaguebringer, and unholy blight, yeah
shame we can’t get a talent to make festering strike extend dot durations like it used to, but it does play as a disease rot build when you spec for it",1,"Nov 11, 2022 1:34 pm"
post_7,"Between frost and unholy, are they about the same in terms of play difficulty?",1,"Nov 11, 2022 1:40 pm"
post_8,"can’t really comment on fdk, since i have touched the spec since cata
But unholy is big on cd execution and resource management still
if you’re able to balance your runes and rp spending properly, you’ll see huge results",0,"Nov 11, 2022 1:42 pm"
post_9,"depends on the build, dots are easier to play than breath for example but you manage more small cds. When I say easier I mean Unholy dots are less dependent on position and if you need to you can use Death Strike where with BOS you have to be careful to only use DS if needed on Dark Succor procs.",0,"Nov 11, 2022 2:19 pm"
post_10,Are you on crack? Frost no matter the build is 100% simpler than any unholy build. BoS is just slightly more complex cause it changes basic rotation a tiny bit.,2,"Nov 11, 2022 3:20 pm"
post_11,Most people would said BOS frost > Unholy >Obliteration Frost for PVE.,1,"Nov 11, 2022 3:49 pm"

post_13,"Glad to see this thread. I’ve also been gone a while, and just picked up the xpac. Hoping to get feedback on how my ole DK might perform. Anyone also play DH? Any thoughts between FDK & DH? Sorry if I’m hijacking.",0,"Nov 15, 2022 5:32 pm"
post_14,"I’m just somewhat disappointed that DK didn’t get any new abilities. While I appreciate the new passives and the talent freedom, I don’t think I’ll get over the fact that my ability bar is exactly the same.",0,"Nov 16, 2022 6:54 pm"
post_15,Are there many classes that did? I know there are some that didn’t. Can’t think of one feral got.,1,"Nov 16, 2022 9:25 pm"
post_16,Quite a lot of specs gained a number of abilities/keybinds that they can talent into with the new trees.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 3:58 am"
post_17,"I have played Paladin, Mage, Monk, Rogue, Hunter, and Priest so far, and they all got new abilities that are also incredibly fun. I don’t know about Blood or Unholy, but Frost got none. My bar is exactly the same as it has been since Battle for Azeroth I think.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 10:05 am"
post_18,"Started really going at it with my frost dk in the prepatch event a d it’s been hella fun. While there’s no new abilities for my personal build, everything just feels like it flows together smoother then it did before. Plus there are some nice small upgrades, like poping off my frostwyrm quicker, or my cute baby frost whelp that helps out when I Piller of Frost.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 12:19 pm"
post_19,"What did paladin get? I only play ret, but i like to familiarize myself with new things.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 12:46 pm"
post_20,with ret they got exorcism and like a new variant of wake of ashes with a talent,0,"Nov 17, 2022 1:18 pm"
post_21,"Ret got exorcism back, with a dot and an aoe modifier for it. It also got Divine Protection and a shorter cooldown version of Wake of Ashes. I’m not even sure DK got any old abilities back.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 1:21 pm"
post_22,Mostly new passives except gained asphyxiate stun and chill streak in pve…which are both good.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 1:59 pm"
post_23,"Ah, i wouldn’t call that new, but i get what you’re saying. The wake variant that turns it into a spender is some new fun, though.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 2:04 pm"
post_24,"Frost got chill streak, that is not the exact same bar. Unless you are completely removing PvE from this equation.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 6:05 pm"
post_25,"Chill Streak is not a new ability and I never used it anyway. So, yes, the bar is exactly the same.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 6:48 pm"
post_26,Enjoying Unholy. Scourge Strike and Death Coil finally feel meaningful to press.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 7:34 pm"
post_27,They’re vastly different styles of play but Havoc feels much more fluid and better designed than Frost.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 7:40 pm"
post_28,Oh do you play unholy? Certainly not frost as it’s a one of their best abilities.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 9:04 pm"
post_29,"It doesn’t matter what I play. Frost, and I am pretty sure DK as a whole, did not receive any new abilities. My bar is the same. Anything else is irrelevant.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 10:11 pm"
post_30,In PvE it’s not.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 10:22 pm"
post_31,That is still irrelevant. DK did not receive a new ability.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 10:28 pm"
post_32,You said your bar is the same in your previous response. I said in PvE it’s not. I never said it was a new ability.,0,"Nov 17, 2022 10:35 pm"
post_33,"But… it is, so you’re just wrong.",0,"Nov 17, 2022 11:02 pm"
post_34,You saying words doesn’t make those words true. Let me dumb this down as it somehow needed to be.,1,"Nov 17, 2022 11:17 pm"
post_35,Your bar is only different if you pick these changes up.,0,"Nov 18, 2022 8:21 am"
post_36,"No, my bar being exactly the same does. You can keep arguing in vain but you’ve been wrong and are still wrong. My bar is exactly the same as it has been for several years. This refusal to accept that you’re wrong is extremely infantile. I’m done here.",0,"Nov 18, 2022 9:17 am"
post_37,Keep burying your head in the sand rather than rebuking my very clearly laid out truth.,0,"Nov 18, 2022 3:28 pm"
post_38,"Unholy got Vile Contagion, only new active ability for dk.
Thats not bad tho i rather the specs play good and fluid than just adding some irrelevant new abilities just for the sake of adding new abilities.
But i must say frost needs an extra button or two in their main rotation because it feels BORING and mind numbing af. 2 buttom spam specs are never fun.",1,"Nov 18, 2022 7:43 pm"
